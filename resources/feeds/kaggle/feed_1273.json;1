        "CINCINNATI \u2014 If there were any doubt that Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren are the \u201cit\u201d couple of the moment in Democratic politics, it was silenced here Monday when they took the stage together for the first time. The two nerdy wonks and feisty grandmothers, who built rival power centers on the political left but this spring gradually became allies, together electrified a crowd of thousands by locking their arms, punching the air and excoriating Donald Trump.",
        "As Donald Trump continues to call Elizabeth Warren \u201dPocahontas\u201d for claiming Native American heritage, former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown who lost to her in 2012 is defending that line of attack. \u201dAs you know, she\u2019s not Native American,\u201d Brown, an early Trump endorser, told reporters on a conference call organized by the Republican National Committee. \u201dShe\u2019s not Cherokee.\u201d In the 2012 race, Brown tried and, for a short time, succeeded in making a campaign issue out of Warren\u2019s claim of Native American ancestry and whether it helped her win academic positions because of affirmative action.",
        "Walter E. Fauntroy, Washington\u2019s legendary former congressional delegate, was arrested Monday morning at Dulles International Airport and jailed in Loudoun County after returning home from a sojourn in the Persian Gulf, authorities said. Fauntroy, who helped plan the 1963 March on Washington with his friend the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested about 8:15 a. m. on an outstanding warrant by Border Patrol officials while he was clearing customs, said Aleksandra Kowalski, a public information officer for the Loudoun County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
        "This story has been updated. In a surprising new study, Stanford researchers have found that California is sitting on top of a vast and previously unrecognized water resource, in the form of deep groundwater, residing at depths between 1, 000 and nearly 10, 000 feet below the surface of the state\u2019s always thirsty Central Valley. The resource amounts to 2, 700 billion tons of freshwater, mostly less than about 3, 250 feet deep, according to the paper published Monday in the influential Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
        "At Sunday\u2019s BET Awards, mega star Beyonc\u00e9 performed on a bed of water, backlit by dancing flames, crying out for \u201cFreedom\u201d in a dazzling spectacle. But it was an actor on a ABC drama who stole the nearly show \u2014 and he did it with an acceptance speech. \u201cYesterday would have been young Tamir Rice\u2019s 14th birthday,\u201d Jesse Williams said, referencing the 2014 fatal police shooting of a Cleveland boy who had been playing with a toy gun.",
        "When Margaret Sawyer first noticed the Red Cross safety poster at a pool in Salida, Colo. she thought she was looking at an unfortunate relic of the past. When she saw it a second time at an entirely different pool in the central Colorado town, she was shocked, according to NBC affiliate KUSA. \u201cI saw this one, and I just kept thinking, \u2018It looks like they\u2019re trying to do something here that shows all kids together of all different backgrounds, but they\u2019re clearly not hitting the mark,\u2019\u201d she said.",
        "When police pulled up to the manicured Houston subdivision Friday evening, after a flood of 911 calls directing them there, they found two young women lying in the street, their bodies bleeding from bullet wounds. Nearby stood their mother, Christy Sheats. In her hand, she held a gun. Authorities demanded that she drop her weapon, according to the Fort Bend County Sheriff\u2019s Office, but she refused. An officer with the Fulshear Police Department opened fire and shot the mother dead. Sheats\u2019s husband and the girls\u2019 father, Jason Sheats, watched the carnage unfold from afar.",
        "Portrait of a man in Mdhilla. (Zied Ben Romdhane) In Gafsa, a phosphate mining region in the southwest of Tunisia, a company called CPG extracts phosphate from the hills. Mining, an important economic resource for the Tunisian economy, has been practiced since Roman times. The local mining villages of Redayef, Mettlaoui and Oumm Laarayes, are rich in resources but marginalized by the government. They remain poor and polluted, a conduit for wealth. Meanwhile, coastal towns prosper. Workers lured from Libya, Morocco, Algeria and around Tunisia live on this nearly uninhabitable land.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Three attackers with suicide vests detonated their explosives at the entrance of Istanbul Ataturk Airport, killing at least 36 people and wounding 147, Turkish officials said Tuesday night. Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, blamed the Islamic State group for the assault, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility. All three bombers were killed. The attack is likely to raise tensions in Turkey, which is fighting a domestic Kurdish insurgency and striking at Islamic State jihadists in Syria.",
        "Conservative hopes for a transformational term at the Supreme Court ended with Justice Antonin Scalia s death this winter, and liberals instead prevailed on what are likely to be the term s most influential decisions. The cases and causes that had the right so excited at the beginning of the term \u201d challenges to affirmative action, restrictions on abortion, complaints about labor union fees, bold attacks on the way electoral districts are drawn and President Obama s use of executive power \u201d ended either with liberal victories or draws that set no precedent.",
        "MONESSEN, Pa. \u2014 Donald Trump on Tuesday channeled more than a year\u2019s worth of fiery and freewheeling protectionist rhetoric into an uncharacteristically disciplined address, putting him out of step with decades of conservative economic orthodoxy and even some of his own prior positions. Speaking in a warehouse filled with piles of compressed aluminum cans and scraps of metal, Trump ticked through a plan to boost domestic job growth that included renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, labeling China a currency manipulator, and withdrawing from the Partnership trade deal and preventing its implementation.",
        "In May, under pressure from the news media, Donald Trump made good on a pledge he made four months earlier: He gave $1 million to a nonprofit group helping veterans\u2019 families. Before that, however, when was the last time that Trump had given any of his own money to a charity? If Trump stands by his promises, such donations should be occurring all the time. In the 15 years prior to the veterans donation, Trump promised to donate earnings from a wide variety of his moneymaking enterprises: \u201cThe Apprentice. \u201d Trump Vodka. Trump University. A book. Another book.",
        "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 In the darkness the warehouse looks like any other, a hangar next to a clattering overpass, with homeless people sleeping nearby in the shadows. But inside, workers quietly unload black plastic crates filled with merchandise so valuable that mobs have looted delivery vehicles, shot up the windshields of trucks and hurled a rock into one driver\u2019s eye. Soldiers and police milling around the loading depots give this neighborhood the feel of a military garrison. \u201cIt\u2019s just cheese,\u201d said Juan Urrea, a driver, as workers unloaded thousands of pounds of white Venezuelan queso from his delivery truck.",
        "The tensions unsettling the Saudi royal family became clear in September, when Joseph Westphal, the U. S. ambassador to Riyadh, flew to Jiddah to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, nominally the heir to the throne. But when he arrived, he was told that the deputy crown prince, a brash named Mohammed bin Salman, wanted to see him urgently. The ambassador was redirected. The United States and the crown prince swallowed the embarrassment.",
        "ON THE night of Sept. 11 and morning of Sept. \u201a12, 2012, U. S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Benghazi, Libya, came under attack by terrorists armed with automatic weapons, mortars and fuel to start fires. By the next morning, four brave Americans lay dead  \u201d Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens; his aide, Sean Smith; and two former Navy SEALs providing security, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. It was a horrific crime whose perpetrators remain for the most part unidentified and unpunished  \u201d and a setback for U. S. foreign policy in the wider Middle East.",
        "The House Select Committee on Benghazi released its findings Tuesday and concluded that . . . well, it looks as though they\u2019re going to have to empanel another select committee to iron out the dueling conclusions reached by various members of the committee. The panel members spent two years and $7 million to come up with the last word on what happened in Libya in September 2012, when four American personnel were killed. They had vowed to best the seven prior congressional investigations and the Obama administration\u2019s own probe.",
        "Jim Ruth is a writer and retired financial adviser. No Trump campaign buttons or bumper stickers for me. I\u2019m part of the new silent majority: those who don\u2019t like Donald Trump but might vote for him anyway. For many of us, Trump has only one redeeming quality: He isn\u2019t Hillary Clinton. He doesn\u2019t want to turn the United States into a politically correct, social democracy where every kid (and adult, too) gets a trophy just for showing up.",
        "Watching Hillary Clinton beaming sidewise onstage as Elizabeth Warren taunted Donald Trump brought the Wrigley twin ditty to mind: Double your pleasure, double your fun, with double good, double good, Doublemint gum. Instead of two happy twins riding a tandem bicycle to celebrate chewing gum, the sixties \u2014 wearing blond bobs and shades of blue \u2014 rode Trump with a gobsmacking double punch. Railed the senator from Massachusetts: \u201cNow, Donald Trump says he\u2019ll make America great again. . . . It\u2019s stamped on the front of his goofy hat. You want to see goofy?",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 European leaders toughened their stance Tuesday against British efforts to leave the European Union amid political chaos in London and other capitals, as E. U. officials gathered in Brussels for the first time since Britons\u2019 shocking vote last week to break from the union. Seeking to prevent a further crackup of their bloc, nervous heads of government are trying to discourage other countries from following Britain\u2019s example, telling London that it cannot preserve access to the world\u2019s largest consumer market if it does not also accept the exact obligation that British voters seemed to reject: open borders.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Standing on the steps of the Irish Embassy in London, Alison Rayner looked at her Irish wife and blurted out: \u201cYou\u2019re European, and I am not!\u201d For Rayner, a British jazz musician who travels around Europe, it was not a comforting thought. But like many Brits, she is considering applying for an Irish passport as a way to cling onto her E. U. citizenship following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. Many Britons are scrambling to apply for passports from countries within the E. U.",
        "A final report issued by the committee that investigated the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, found fault with virtually every element of the response to the attacks but provided no new evidence of specific wrongdoing by of State Hillary Clinton. A committee news release said the report \u201cfundamentally changes the public\u2019s understanding of the 2012 terrorist attacks that killed four Americans,\u201d including the U. S. ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens.",
        "Even in the highly competitive, world of cable television, there should be a bridge too far. In hiring Donald Trump\u2019s fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, CNN ran blithely across that bridge and plunged into a sea of muck. Bringing Lewandowski onboard is an astonishing reward for behavior that should cause him to be shunned by respectable journalistic organizations. His manhandling of Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields at a campaign rally was deplorable, but it\u2019s only a symptom of a larger problem. (And, yes, I know the criminal charges against Lewandowski were dropped; that doesn\u2019t mean the incident didn\u2019t happen.",
        "On Monday night, the Associated Press published a piece noting the release of an additional 165 pages of emails Hillary Clinton sent from her private email address while serving as secretary of state. These were emails that had never been previously released and only were made public because of a court order in response to a request from a conservative group. And yet again, the emails poke holes in Clinton\u2019s initial explanation for why she decided to exclusively use a private email server for her electronic correspondence while serving as the nation\u2019s top diplomat.",
        "The Democratic presidential primaries ended two weeks ago today. Bernie Sanders is still kind of, sort of running for the nomination, despite the fact he has lost by every possible metric to Hillary Clinton. Clinton and her campaign have been generally fine with all of this, pivoting to the general election and assuming the Sanders thing would work itself out. Caption The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and the Massachusetts senator electrified a crowd by locking arms and excoriating Donald Trump, the GOP presumptive nominee. June 27, 2016 Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, left, and Sen.",
        "\u201cSo who is all for women until she isn\u2019t? When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, \u2018Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believed.\u2019 But when another Bill [Clinton] was accused of sexual assault? Not so much. \u2026 She savaged their dignity and shamed them. [Shows a video clip of Clinton saying] \u2018Some folks are going to have a lot to answer for.",
        "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 For more than two decades, I\u2019ve been asked what Pat Summitt is really like, and failed to answer the question, for the simple reason that most words aren\u2019t large enough to capture her. Paltry terms can\u2019t describe the roiling, sparkling ocean of a person that Pat was. I know of just a few words that really summarize her, and it turns out they are deceptively simple, and they are her own. They follow below.",
        "Animal activists have shuddered for years at how supermarket chickens meet their end. Across the industry, they are hung upside down, often breaking their bones, bruising their legs and causing hemorrhages. Workers then cut their throats to kill them, before they\u2019re plunked in boiling water. Now, America\u2019s chicken producer is introducing changes that animal rights groups are championing as a major step forward in animal welfare.",

        "There\u2019s great news for women who dread that annual pelvic exam (i. e. basically everyone). On Tuesday, a panel made up of medical experts that advise the government said that there\u2019s not enough evidence to support doing them for women who are healthy and not pregnant. The conclusion, issued as a draft recommendation by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, is a strong endorsement of the recent evidence that has been building against the practice that is performed 63 million times annually and is estimated to cost $2. 6 billion.",
        "Furniture giant Ikea is recalling and issuing refunds for more than 35 million chests and dressers after six children died when the furniture tipped over on them. The Swedish company announced Tuesday that it is giving customers in the United States and Canada full refunds for a number of chests and dressers, including its popular Malm line manufactured between January 2002 and June 2016, as well as partial refunds for affected furniture manufactured before 2002. The company is also offering free kits to customers who would like to keep their dressers."
