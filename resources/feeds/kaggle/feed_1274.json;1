        "A Washington tourist has been thrust into a national spotlight after video showing her reluctant but powerful impromptu performance of \u201cThe Banner\u201d at the Lincoln Memorial swept social media. Star Swain, a assistant principal from Tallahassee, visited the memorial recently with friends and relatives who started goading her to sing the national anthem. \u201cWhat started out as a dare turned into all of this,\u201d Benny Bolden, a friend and elder at her church, told The Washington Post.

        "Rescue legislation aimed at helping Puerto Rico address its mounting fiscal crisis cleared Congress Wednesday, two days before the U. S. territory is set to default on roughly $2 billion in debt payments. The bill passed by the Senate on a vote opens a path for an orderly restructuring of the island\u2019s $72 billion in bond debt while creating a new federally appointed fiscal oversight board. It passed the House earlier this month, and President Obama has said he will sign it.",
        "Sir Roger Gale was puzzled when a string of emails from Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign landed in his inbox. As a Briton and a member of Parliament, Gale is barred by U. S. law from giving Trump money, much less voting for him. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten rid of most of that rubbish,\u201d he said in an interview. The emails to Gale were among a wave of fundraising pleas inexplicably sent by the Trump campaign in recent days to lawmakers in the United Kingdom, Iceland, Australia and elsewhere.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkish authorities combed through video clips and witness accounts Wednesday, seeking to reconstruct how three suicide bombers laid siege to the country\u2019s largest airport, killing at least 41 people and raising questions over whether Turkey could step up its fight against the Islamic State. At least 13 foreigners were killed in the late Tuesday attack, including five from Saudi Arabia and others from China, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. At least 239 people were wounded, and a national day of mourning was declared on Wednesday, officials said.",
        "Bill Genovese didn\u2019t realize how many people knew his sister\u2019s name until he joined the Marines in 1966. Two years after Kitty Genovese was stabbed to death in Queens while 38 neighbors watched and did nothing \u2014 or so the story went \u2014 he was in line during boot camp, waiting for a piece of equipment. \u201cGenovese, William,\u201d said the man checking names off a list. \u201cIs your sister Kitty?\u201d \u201cAnd I looked at him like, what?\u201d Genovese recalls 50 years later.

        "William M. Daley is a former commerce secretary and White House chief of staff. Bernie Sanders is making a big and potentially dangerous mistake with his continuing insistence on changes to the Democratic Party s rules and platform. I should know. As chairman of Al Gore s 2000 presidential campaign, I understand too well where such ideological stubbornness can lead. Back then, many progressives insisted on backing candidate Ralph Nader despite warnings it would undercut the Democratic nominee. Nader received 97, 421 votes in Florida, which Gore lost by 537 votes. The result? President George W.",
        "Et tu, Trey? A day after the House Benghazi committee released a final report that left Hillary Clinton relatively unscathed, conservative activists \u2014 the ones who pressured House leaders to appoint the committee in the first place \u2014 rounded on Chairman Trey Gowdy for failing to deliver the goods. \u201cTo say I was disappointed would be an understatement,\u201d retired Admiral James \u201cAce\u201d Lyons complained at a meeting Wednesday afternoon of the Citizens\u2019 Commission on Benghazi, a coalition of types. \u201cChairman Gowdy is not a stenographer \u2026 He was there to make findings and conclusions. He had the information.",
        "So on Tuesday, Donald Trump gave a spectacularly ignorant speech on trade and the American economy. The staff here at Spoiler Alerts could go on at length about how Trump is just repeating a Big Lie about the global economy, but the staff has done that before. Many times before. Many, many times. So instead, at a moment when everyone and their mother is talking about how populism is on the rise and such, let\u2019s talk about how Trump is offering up an extreme test of whether elites will continue to matter at all.",
        "Doug Sosnik, a Democratic political strategist, was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 2000. If history is any guide, the outcome of this year\u2019s presidential election has already been decided. With the exception of 2000, the result of every presidential election since, and including, 1980 has been determined before the general election even officially began. In fact, most of these elections were effectively decided by this point in the cycle.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Some of our wisest political observers informed us that Brexit would be great news for Donald Trump, because it shows (somehow) that there may be more support here than expected for his nationalist message of restoring American greatness through restrictionist immigration policies and turning the clock back on globalization. So it\u2019s a bit surprising to see that a new Consult poll shows that Brexit will not influence the votes of a majority of Americans, and if anything, may benefit Hillary Clinton marginally more than Trump: A majority of U. S.",

Steve Fitzgerald dismissed a colleague\u2019s concern about suicide among transgender youth by arguing that \u201cSuicide does have a high rate with those who are afflicted with some form of insanity. \u201d Iowa Congressman Steve King has called for \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d to block transgender rights.

        "In the early morning of June 6, a uniformed Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) guard stationed outside the U. S. Embassy in Moscow attacked and beat up a U. S. diplomat who was trying to enter the compound, according to four U. S. officials who were briefed on the incident. This previously unreported attack occurred just steps from the entrance to the U. S. Embassy complex, which is located in the Presnensky District in Moscow\u2019s city center. After being tackled by the FSB guard, the diplomat suffered a broken shoulder, among other injuries.",
        "Dozens of Republicans aren\u2019t showing up. There\u2019s no word yet on who will speak. A growing number of corporate sponsors are taking a pass. Groups of white supremacists and other agitators are on the way, while the official protest routes are frantically being redrawn after being thrown out in court. And then there\u2019s the fight to dethrone the big star.

        "For the first time in U. S. political history, an openly transgender candidate won a congressional primary. In fact, on Tuesday, two did. At least one longtime LGBT rights advocate said it\u2019s a big moment for the transgender community that, frankly, comes as a bit of a surprise. The Fix could find only one other transgender candidate local or national who won their first election after coming out.",
        "Before Scott Brown lost his Senate reelection bid to to Elizabeth Warren in 2012, the race briefly centered on a weird topic: Warren\u2019s ancestry. For years, Warren had described herself as being of Native American heritage, a belief based on \u201dfamily stories\u201d but which didn\u2019t appear to be bolstered by any actual evidence. Brown seized on the discrepancy in an effort to paint Warren as dishonest or deceptive, focusing on her having been identified as Native American at Harvard with the suggestion that Warren might have used her alleged identity to get ahead.",
        "The Marine Corps is investigating allegations of hazing, physical abuse and assault against 15 drill instructors at the Parris Island recruit depot, Marine officials said Wednesday, broadening the scope of a probe first disclosed after the death of a Muslim recruit in March. The investigation centers on the installation\u2019s 3rd Recruit Training Battalion, and was launched at Parris Island in November, Marine officials said.

        "In early June, Dinesh and Tarakeshwari Rathod told reporters that they had climbed the highest peak in the world, Mount Everest. In doing so, the two \u2014 both police officers from the city of Pune \u2014 were thought to have become the first Indian couple to conquer the Everest together.

        "After the angry outcry over #OscarsSoWhite earlier this year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences appears to be taking seriously its pledge to double the number of women and minorities in its voting ranks by 2020. The Academy revealed today the 683 people it has invited to be new members, and the acting list alone is extremely diverse. Of the 69 actors invited, 25 are black, 15 are Hispanic and seven are Asian. There\u2019s one actor of Maori descent and one Native Canadian. Nearly half are women. The list also skews younger than the Academy average.",

        "Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter repealed the Pentagon\u2019s ban on transgender people serving in the military Thursday, ending a process that was bogged down by internal conflict and concerns among senior service officials about how the change could be made. Carter said at a news conference that the policy change will take place over the next 12 months, beginning with guidance issued to current transgender service members and their commanders, followed by training for the entire military.",
        "LONDON \u2014 It was a scene lifted from the scripts of Shakespeare \u2014 or perhaps a session of \u201cHouse of Cards. \u201d When Thursday morning broke, Boris Johnson, the transparently ambitious former mayor of London, was preparing to give the speech of his life \u2014 one that would vault him out of the political mayhem wrought by last week\u2019s referendum on the European Union and straight to the job he had long sought: British prime minister.",
        "Adnan Syed, whose murder conviction became the subject of the popular podcast \u201cSerial,\u201d has been granted a new trial.

        "TAIZ, Yemen \u2014 The streets are eerily silent in this enclave near Freedom Square, where thousands of protesters rose up against the government five years ago. The presidential palace nearby survived the demonstrations but not the war that followed. It is now a concrete carcass, pummeled by airstrikes. Shops are shuttered and homes are empty. The only people who remain cannot afford to go anywhere else. By day, snipers strike down residents. At night, the gunfire and artillery shelling start. \u201cWe\u2019re trapped by all the sides,\u201d said Ghulam Sayed, a former bus driver.",

        "Federal regulators on Thursday issued an urgent warning to owners of more than 300, 000 Hondas and Acuras, saying they should not drive their vehicles until the Takata air bags are replaced. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said a new round of tests on the Takata air bags installed in some Hondas and Acuras posed a much higher threat to drivers and passengers than first thought. The agency said the air bags needed immediate replacement. In collisions, the faulty Takata air bags can rupture and spray drivers and passengers with metal shrapnel.",
        "I\u2019ve really struggled with how to write about the results of two polls on race released this week. So, let me just toss out the two findings that have induced this paralysis. According to the poll, \u201cSupporters of U.
