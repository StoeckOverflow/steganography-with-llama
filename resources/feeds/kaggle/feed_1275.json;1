        "The word \u201cpopulism\u201d has had a good week, but President Obama took issue with the meaning of that word Wednesday in Ottawa: It\u2019s a bit but we here at Spoiler Alerts applaud the president for challenging conceptual premises. Indeed, the staff here at Spoiler Alerts likes to look at public opinion polls to see if things are actually popular. For example, despite claims to the contrary, it\u2019s not at all obvious that the American people have turned .",
        "Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality. It\u2019s enlightening to see that Brits can be just as dense as anyone else, especially for us old Anglophiles who venerate the dropped R, the broad A, the lift, the loo, the brolly, the banger and that ridiculous game in which the pitcher throws a bad pitch and the batter swings a shovel at it and runs the wrong way.",
        "\u201cSee that little stream? We could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a month to walk to it \u2014 a whole empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind. \u201d \u2014 F. Scott Fitzgerald, \u201cTender Is the Night\u201d The walk began at 7:30 a. m. July 1, 1916 when British infantry advanced toward German trenches. In the first hours, eight British soldiers fell per second. By nightfall, 19, 240 were dead, 38, 230 more were wounded. World War I, the worst disaster in human experience, was the hinge of modern history.",
        "Feminist has come to sound like a cliche \u2014 a misogynist caricature. Feminism, its loudest proponents vow, is about fighting for equality. The label is either a smear or a misunderstanding. Yet a lot of feminist rhetoric today does cross the line from attacks on sexism into attacks on men, with a strong focus on personal behavior: the way they talk, the way they approach relationships, even the way they sit on public transit. Male faults are stated as sweeping condemnations; objecting to such generalizations is taken as a sign of complicity.",
        "Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with former president Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix this week \u2014 an encounter that she described as \u201cprimarily social,\u201d but one that drew instant attention because of the Justice Department\u2019s ongoing investigation into the email practices of his wife, Hillary Clinton, while she was secretary of state. Lynch publicly confirmed the meeting, first reported by ABC15 and others, saying it occurred at the airport where she had just landed for a stop on her nationwide tour of law enforcement agencies.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has begun formally vetting possible running mates, with former House speaker Newt Gingrich emerging as the leading candidate, followed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. But there are more than a half dozen others being discussed as possibilities, according to several people with knowledge of the process. Given Trump\u2019s unpredictability, campaign associates caution that the presumptive Republican nominee could still shake up his shortlist.",
        "Richard Armitage, Henry Paulson, Brent Scowcroft. Three former George W. Bush administration officials in the past two weeks have announced that they are supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 all because Donald Trump is simply a bridge too far for them. \u201dWhen it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump,\u201d Paulson wrote in The Washington Post last week. \u201dI will not cast a vote.",
        "The House could vote next week on a bill aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told fellow Republican members on a conference call Thursday about the upcoming legislative agenda. But that bill would almost certainly not be the one that Democrats spent 27 hours on the House floor last week demanding a vote on. Ryan ( .) said the bill could come up next week as part of a package of bills aimed at combating terrorist radicalization and recruitment, according to a GOP aide who was on the call.",
        "In a major new paper in the influential journal Science, a team of researchers report strikingly good news about a thirty year old environmental problem. The Antarctic ozone \u201chole\u201d \u2014 which, when it was first identified in the focused public attention like few other pieces of environmental news \u2014 has begun, in their words, to finally \u201cheal.",
        "In late October 2014, the FBI received an unusual email from a young man named Mohimanul Alam Bhuiya. Bhuiya, then 25, had joined the Islamic State. Now the longtime Brooklyn resident was desperate and looking for a way out. He wanted the FBI to rescue him. \u201cI am an American who\u2019s trying to get back home from Syria,\u201d he wrote in his email, according to federal court documents unsealed last month. \u201cI just want to get back home. All I want is this extraction, complete exoneration thereafter, and have everything back to normal with me and my family.",
        "For years, American \u201d tourists\u201d have flocked to unregulated clinics in Mexico, the Caribbean and China in search of everything from heart treatments to facelifts. But now, these kinds of clinics are popping up across the United States. According to a new study, at least 351 companies with 570 clinics are marketing unapproved treatments for conditions such as osteoarthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s, autism and injured spinal cords, as well as for cosmetic enhancements.",
        "Chronic fatigue syndrome, perhaps more than any other disease, has a bad rap. It makes you debilitatingly tired from normal tasks but no amount of rest can help. There\u2019s no blood test or other easily read biomarkers, so many doctors are reluctant to diagnose the condition no matter how bad things get. Scientists have finally shed some light on the condition, finding that your gut bacteria and inflammatory agents in the blood may have something to do with it.",
        "Chocolate giant Hershey has rejected a takeover bid that would have created the world\u2019s largest candymaker, a rare rebuttal in a food industry increasingly marked by . Mondelez International, the maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies, offered nearly $23 billion in cash and stock to buy America\u2019s biggest chocolate conglomerate. But Hershey, known for its Kisses and Kit Kats, announced Thursday that its board of directors had unanimously rejected the bid, saying they \u201cdetermined that it provided no basis for further discussion. \u201d Mondelez representatives declined to comment.",
        "Gan Renxian releases adult mosquitoes in a village on Shazai Island. (Kevin Images) A woman sweeps in front of her house as mosquitoes are released nearby. (Kevin Images) In the world\u2019s largest mosquito farm, millions of males are being bred at a furious pace for release on an island in Southern China. It\u2019s all part of a plan to suppress a mosquito that can transmit the Zika virus. And so far, the results are stunning. The man behind this experiment is Xi Zhiyong, professor at Sun University and Michigan State University.",
        "The United States has inadvertently killed between 64 and 116 civilians in drone and other lethal air attacks against terrorism suspects in zones, the Obama administration said Friday. In releasing only aggregate figures that did not include when or where the strikes occurred, the administration shielded those claims from meaningful public scrutiny, even as it sought to bolster its own assertions about the accuracy and effectiveness of the operations. Independent groups, whose own tracking of civilian deaths have produced far higher numbers, said they appreciated the administration\u2019s effort.",
        "Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said Friday that she would accept recommendations from career prosecutors and FBI agents leading the probe into the use of a private email server by Hillary Clinton during her time as secretary of state \u2014 though she stopped short of fully removing herself or other political appointees from the case. The announcement from Lynch was a clear attempt to quiet mounting criticism that she \u2014 as the head of the Justice Department in a Democratic administration \u2014 cannot be trusted to oversee the probe of the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Having vanquished two the bespectacled Scotsman vying to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister squinted out at his country Friday and etched a shiny vision of the future, one undimmed by the chaos he himself has wrought. Britain, Michael Gove said as he pitched himself for the country\u2019s top job, will be a more enterprising and prosperous place now that it has opted to throw off the shackles of the European Union. It will have additional money for health care, one less layer of burdensome regulation and far fewer immigrants.",
        "Did Donald Trump violate IRS rules, by using a charity\u2019s money to buy himself a signed football helmet? Four years ago, at a charity fundraiser in Palm Beach, Donald Trump got into a bidding war at the evening\u2019s live auction. The items up for sale: A Denver Broncos helmet, autographed by quarterback Tim Tebow, and a Tebow jersey. Trump won, eventually, with a bid of $12, 000. Afterward, he posed with the helmet. His purchase made news: a flourish of generosity, by a mogul with money to burn.",
        "Marc Racicot is a former governor of Montana and former chairman of the Republican National Committee. As our beloved country marks its 240th birthday, I\u2019m not alone in feeling that we occupy a moment of great turmoil and testing as a nation. Maybe we\u2019ve taken the wonders and blessings of our country for granted, never thinking the grand experiment of our Founding Fathers, so dependent for its endurance upon mutual decency, respect and could ever really fall into disrepair.",
        "Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s tarmac conversation with Bill Clinton wasn\u2019t just stupid, although it was certainly that. It was a colossal misjudgment on both sides, most especially hers. The encounter was toxic. It adds to the already settled conviction among too many voters that the system is, to use the essential word of the 2016 campaign, rigged. In this view, the fix \u2014 political, financial and judicial \u2014 is in, the playing field irrevocably tilted in favor of the powerful, the rich and the .",
        "Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, had a message to deliver. \u201cHillary Clinton is the epitome of the establishment; she\u2019s been in power for 25 years,\u201d he informed Chuck Todd on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last Sunday. When Trump, Manafort added, \u201csays he\u2019s going to bring real change to the country, voters believe him \u2014 unlike Mrs. Clinton, who has been saying that for 25 years and in those 25 years, the only changes that have happened have made people\u2019s lives worse.",
        "Is China secretly punishing Kim Jong Un for his nuclear mischief? Following North Korea\u2019s latest nuclear test, in January, trade over the Korea border dropped dramatically, according to newly released satellite imagery. The revelation has led experts to conclude that Beijing has been quietly punishing Kim by cutting off the flow of funds to his regime. There\u2019s no question that the Korea relationship has been strained since Kim assumed power in 2011.",
        "He can\u2019t do it, Republicans. It\u2019s time for you to admit that Donald Trump is incapable of even pretending to be an acceptable candidate for president. The question is which side of history you want to be on. Are you going to stand with him as the balloons drop on the last night of the convention, knowing he shares neither your views nor your values? Are you going to work your hearts out this fall to put an unstable bully in charge of our national defense?",
        "In the late 1980s, I was introduced to a Satanic high priestess. She called herself a witch and dressed the part, with flowing dark clothes and black eye shadow around to her temples. In our many discussions, she acknowledged worshipping Satan as his \u201cqueen. \u201d I\u2019m a man of science and a lover of history; after studying the classics at Princeton, I trained in psychiatry at Yale and in psychoanalysis at Columbia. That background is why a Catholic priest had asked my professional opinion, which I offered pro bono, about whether this woman was suffering from a mental disorder.",

        "The crash that killed a Tesla driver in Florida when his car struck a may mark the world\u2019s first fatal accident in which a computer was at the wheel. The crash occurred when the truck turned left across the 2015 Model S Tesla\u2019s path and the car\u2019s autopilot failed to slow down. The deadly accident, which took the life of Joshua David Brown of Ohio and is the subject of a federal safety investigation that Tesla disclosed Thursday, is bound to raise a lot of questions about vehicle automation and the future of car travel.",
        "Four years after federal agents showed up at his Frederick, Md. farmhouse and told him that they had seized the money in his bank account, dairy farmer Randy Sowers has gotten it all back. The victory followed political pressure from Congress and legal pressure from the libertarian Institute for Justice on the government to roll back prosecution of the crime of structuring bank deposits to avoid Internal Revenue Service reporting requirements. \u201cI\u2019m happy in more ways than one,\u201d Sowers said after the announcement. \u201cGetting my money back and defeating something that was wrong.",
        "In the truest spirit of a global brand, Donald Trump has mastered the art of being as many things to as many people as possible. Specificity does you no good except to pin you down to something that someone may not like. That\u2019s why even Trump\u2019s most fervent assertions build the wall, ban Muslims are surrounded by a cloud of probability, with the campaign or surrogates stating or implying that the positions will soften or change.",
        "attempts by a group of Republican delegates seeking to stop Donald Trump from becoming the GOP presidential nominee are quickly fading and now their fight is facing a federal legal challenge.

        "Sen. Elizabeth Warren looked very much like a running mate as she stood alongside Hillary Clinton and electrified a large crowd in battleground Ohio this week, punching the air, eviscerating Republican Donald Trump and declaring: \u201cI\u2019m with her. Yes, her. \u201d Not everyone was impressed \u2014 including some supporters of Democratic Bernie Sanders, who remain hostile to Clinton and bitter that Warren ( .) didn\u2019t back the senator from Vermont during the primaries."
