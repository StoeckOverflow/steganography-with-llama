        "Tuesday\u2019s terrorist attack on Ataturk International Airport in Istanbul has again has renewed the debate among security experts about whether the United States should widen the security perimeter beyond the airport terminal. As with the March 22 attack on Brussels\u2019 airport, the Istanbul strike focused security officials on the daunting challenge of trying to secure transportation hubs and other public spaces without unduly impeding travel and business.",
        "A week isn\u2019t very long to learn a new job, so it\u2019s possible Corey Lewandowski will improve in his role as a CNN commentator. But so far, Donald Trump\u2019s recently fired campaign manager is just plain bad \u2014 and not only for the reasons many anticipated. His volatile relationship with journalists was before the hiring, and already there have been a few awkward moments between Lewandowski and his new colleagues.",
        "To be a freegan is to be a person who avoids exchanging money for food and other items \u2014 you recycle what is still good instead. To accomplish this, however, one has to be creative, maybe even nocturnal. \u201cAfter the markets close, the shopkeepers put food on the sidewalk,\u201d explains Aliza Eliazarov, who discovered this world of freeganism while on a newspaper assignment about dumpster diving. \u201cMost of the food doesn\u2019t even make it into the trash because people are there waiting for it.",

        "CANAVERAL NATIONAL SEASHORE, Fla. \u2014 This secluded beach on a barrier island off the Atlantic coast is a sunbathers\u2019 paradise of nesting sea turtles and wading shore birds in the shadow of the Kennedy Space Center. But for rangers, visitor guides and many of the 50 employees here, working at this national park is anything but paradise. Multiple female employees have been subjected to sexual harassment, and men and women alike to a hostile workplace for at least five years at Canaveral, government reports show.",
        "DHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh just realized one of its worst fears. The South Asian nation, no stranger to either vicious politics or targeted Islamist killings, this weekend experienced its deadliest and most sophisticated attack yet, in what appeared to be a calculated blow against the country\u2019s elite, including its foreign residents. The Holey Artisan Bakery and its restaurant, known as O\u2019Kitchen, is a modest establishment that represents global dreams \u2014 and wallets.",
        "FBI agents interviewed Hillary Clinton for 3\u00bd hours Saturday morning \u2014 a signal that the investigation into her use of a private email account while she was secretary of state is drawing to a close.

        "Bill Clinton has made a mess. It was either out of foolish indifference or plain foolishness, but it has created a terrible moment for his wife and the Democrats, and for President Obama and perceptions of the integrity of his administration. Clinton\u2019s private, unplanned meeting with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch at the Phoenix airport last week, coming at a time when the Justice Department should be nearing completion of its examination of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state, will inevitably \u2014 and negatively \u2014 affect public attitudes about that investigation.",
        "A few months back, after returning from a family vacation that involved lots of pool time, my son complained that his ear hurt. A Sunday morning trip to urgent care brought a diagnosis of swimmer\u2019s ear \u2014 an infection of the outer ear canal \u2014 and a prescription for ear drops. When my wife went to fill the prescription, for a quarter of an ounce, she was told that our share of the cost would be $135. Even with the increasingly high cost of drugs, that seemed like a lot.",
        "The 2016 election is about class. \u201cFor the first time in a generation, the working class is front and center in an election cycle,\u201d one MarketWatch writer proclaimed. Commentators fret that Hillary Clinton has \u201clost\u201d the working class and that Donald Trump has risen to prominence on the backs of \u201cwhite trash. \u201d (Never mind that Trump voters are, on average, wealthier than Clinton\u2019s constituency.) Bernie Sanders even calls himself the working class candidate.",
        "July 4 is the high holy day of hot dogs. Though the Founding Fathers didn\u2019t indulge, this meat treat has been with us for nearly 150 years \u2014 nestled into American pop culture like, well, a steaming hot dog in a bun. President Franklin D. Roosevelt even served them to King George VI and his family during their 1939 visit to the Roosevelts\u2019 home in Hyde Park, N. Y. (\u201cKing Tries Hot Dog and Asks for More,\u201d one amazed headline read.) Hot dogs play a key role in film, television and literature. Here are some of my favorite examples.",

The National Zoo has announced that for the first time in 25 years, two of its endangered Bornean orangutans, Batang and Kyle, have successfully conceived, with a baby due in September. Batang, who zoo officials say was trained to help track her ovulation cycle, is now training for motherhood.

        "Rolling Stone journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely spent five months investigating a shocking claim of a gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity, and the account of the brutal attack published online on Nov. 19, 2014, sent a tremor through the Charlottesville campus and beyond.

Erdely sent an to the magazine\u2019s editors, Will Dana and Sean Woods, with a simple subject line: \u201cOur worst nightmare. \u201d The body of the message detailed how Erdely no longer trusted the primary source for the most striking anecdote in her article: a .",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday tweeted an image of rival Hillary Clinton alongside $100 bills and a Jewish star bearing the words \u201cmost corrupt candidate ever!\u201d prompting outrage and bafflement on social media. Two hours after his initial tweet, Trump tweeted a similar image in which the Star of David \u2014 which appears on Israel\u2019s flag and which Jews were forced to wear on their clothing by the Nazis during the Holocaust \u2014 was replaced by a circle.

        "The summer sun is blazing down, and at the National World War II Memorial, shade is hard to come by. You stare at the inviting pool, the jets of cool water spurting from the memorial\u2019s fountain beckon you forward. Do you dip your toes in or, better yet, wade in for relief from the heat? You could, but you would be violating National Park Service rules \u2014 as signs at the memorial clearly state. And, in the minds of some, it is also tacky and disrespectful.",
        "In July 2014, Michelle Carter\u2019s boyfriend committed suicide in a Kmart parking lot. After his death, Carter texted a friend. \u201cLike, honestly I could have stopped it,\u201d she wrote. But instead of trying to stop her teenage boyfriend from taking his life, prosecutors in Massachusetts believe that Carter pressured Conrad Roy III to go through with the act. And on Friday, the state\u2019s highest court ruled that she could go to trial for her alleged role in his death. \u201cI hope they hold her accountable for her actions,\u201d Roy\u2019s grandfather, Conrad Roy Sr. told the Boston Globe.",

        "\u201cFuture shock is the shattering stress and disorientation that we induce in individuals by subjecting them to too much change in too short a time. \u201d Those are the words of the author and futurist Alvin Toffler, who died this week at 87. They come from his most famous work, the book \u201cFuture Shock,\u201d which was published in 1970, but whose core tenets feel utterly of the moment, at least in Hollywood.",
        "This morning, the Pew Research Center released a new report on how Americans are paid by race and gender \u2014 and boy, are there some bombshells for those interested in our nation\u2019s wage disparities. We talk (and argue) often about the gender wage gap, that women in the United States make, on average, 79 cents for every dollar paid to men, according to government data. Economists say this earnings chasm comes from a blend of career choices, discrimination and unconscious bias. (See a more thorough explanation here.) Pew found women typically still take home smaller paychecks than men.",

        "Over several road trips with a in my SUV, I\u2019ve come to appreciate driving to faraway places but exploring them on a vehicle. At my destination and along the way, I hop on a bike to breathe fresh air, get my bearings, stretch my limbs and act like a local for a spell. Cycling allows you to access routes impractical or unreachable by automobile; and unfailingly, getting out of the car on a road trip sets the stage for serendipity. When you slow from 70 mph to 15, the joy is in the unexpected.",
        "Massacres attributed to the Islamic State have struck on four continents this year, reflecting how the appeal of the group\u2019s ideology is growing even as the territory it controls in Iraq and Syria has receded, according to experts. The slaughter of civilians in three large attacks in the past week alone \u2014 in Istanbul on Tuesday, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Friday, and in Baghdad on Sunday \u2014 suggests that militant actions beyond the caliphate\u2019s borders are taking place more frequently and not necessarily with any overt direction from some caliphate headquarters.",

But the image that Trump chose to illustrate his point, which portrayed a red Star of David shape slapped onto a bed of $100 bills, had origins in the online movement. For at least the fifth time, Trump\u2019s Twitter account had shared a meme from the racist \u201c \u201d and offered no explanation why.",

VORU, Estonia \u2014 When unidentified aircraft were speeding toward northern Estonia one recent day, British fighter jets stationed nearby scrambled to intercept them.
