        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one part of the American people to affirm the political bands which connect them to the other parts, and to assume within the nation, the connected and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature\u2019s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of their fellow citizens requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to affirm their connection.",
        "Sara J. Bloomfield is director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 1973, five years before President Carter would appoint Elie Wiesel to chair a commission to determine how the United States should memorialize the Holocaust, Wiesel was already a prominent author and thinker. On the other side of the planet, I was an untested middle school English teacher in Sydney, Australia, fresh out of an American college. No one could have predicted that 20 years later we would be together at the opening of the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.",
        "SANDWICH, Mass. It is the birthright of all Americans to be patriotic in their own way, something worth remembering at a moment of great political division. Instead of challenging each other\u2019s love of country, we should accept that deep affection can take different forms. There is, of course, the option of setting politics aside altogether on the Fourth of July. Anyone who loves baseball, hot dogs, barbecues, fireworks and beaches as much as I do has no problem with that. Still, I\u2019m not a fan of papering over our disagreements.",
        "On this Fourth of July, Americans are deeply disillusioned with politics and government. A Pew poll late last year found that only 19 percent of people trust the government all or most of the time. It was not always so. In 1964, fully 77 percent of Americans answered the question positively. Disenchantment extends to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, their parties\u2019 presumptive nominees. Both have \u201cunfavorable\u201d ratings exceeding 50 percent, reports RealClearPolitics. For millions of Americans, the election is a choice between evils. Politics and government seem broken. There is a palpable sense of betrayal.",
        "Josh Rogin is a Washington Post Global Opinions columnist. The U. S. relationship is too big to fail, but it\u2019s failing. The Obama administration came into office with a big idea about this relationship: that these two world powers must work together on areas of mutual interest even if they still worked against each other where their interests diverged. The concept was sound, but as relations have deteriorated and Russia has taken a more antagonistic stance, the United States has failed to adapt.",
        "DONALD TRUMP, perhaps the greatest braggart ever to aspire to national office, is hardly shy about flaunting \u2014 or rather hyping \u2014 his good works. So it has been with his charitable giving, which, for the better part of 30 years, he has regularly exaggerated to the point of plain mendacity. That Mr. Trump in his public utterances is a serial embellisher is no surprise. Still, the shamelessness by which his actual giving to worthy causes has trailed his public claims of generosity is stunning.",
        "A college student from Fairfax, Va. was seriously injured Sunday in New York City\u2019s Central Park when he unwittingly jumped on explosive material that had been left next to a rock, according to police and his family. The bizarre accident forced the amputation of Connor Golden\u2019s left leg below the knee and set the nation\u2019s city on edge a day before the July 4 holiday was expected to draw thousands to watch the city\u2019s annual fireworks display.",
        "Last month, Vice President Biden penned a searing letter to the victim in a notorious Stanford University rape case. \u201cI am filled with furious anger,\u201d he wrote, \u201cboth that this happened to you and that our culture is still so broken. \u201d Biden\u2019s letter encapsulated the national outrage that erupted when the woman\u2019s attacker was sentenced to just six months in county jail. It was also a sharp reminder that one of the Obama administration\u2019s most ardent policy initiatives has been a concerted campaign to end the scourge of sexual assault on college campuses.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 Britain may be in danger of becoming an nation of diminished influence following its vote to leave the European Union. But one country could find its voice in Europe dramatically amplified: Germany. Under the stewardship of Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe\u2019s largest economy has already ridden to the zenith of its War II power. But the pending departure of the E. U.\u2019s economy \u2014 Britain \u2014 could thrust an even bigger burden of leadership upon Germany. Some Europeans remain leery of German power \u2014 the very energy the E. U.",
        "SPRING, Texas \u2014 The soaring height is the first thing you notice, followed by the power. How can a sprite launch herself skyward with such amplitude and explosion, as if ? Then it\u2019s the dazzling smile as she flips, twists and spins over the vault, across the balance beam, around the uneven bars and from one corner of the floor to the next. Simone Biles\u2019s gymnastics simply don\u2019t look like anyone else\u2019s. Biles competes with a joy and abandon that has been lacking in women\u2019s gymnastics in recent years.",
        "Sometimes, Chris Santore believes, more is more. That will be his approach Monday night, when he plans to pack more than 5, 000 fireworks into minutes for the Fourth of July celebration on the Mall. So much bang in such a small window of time means a experience for the throngs of spectators watching explosions 1, 500 feet up in the sky. \u201cThe finale is just \u201d Santore said. The display will \u201cscream \u2018July Fourth in Washington, D. C.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s an appropriate tone to set.",
        "RALEIGH, N. C. \u2014 Politically turbulent North Carolina, where Barack Obama won in 2008 and then Republicans rose up to engineer a conservative revolution, has suddenly emerged as a focal point in the presidential race. The battle lines will be clear Tuesday in dueling rallies in the state\u2019s two major cities. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will appear in Charlotte alongside President Obama, who is making his debut on the campaign trail and will try to reenergize his multiethnic coalition.",
        "Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson on Sunday went where Hillary Clinton has refused to go, saying Donald Trump is \u201dclearly\u201d racist. \u201dBased on his statements, clearly,\u201d Johnson said on CNN\u2019s \u201dState of the Union.\u201d \u201dI mean, if statements are being made, is that not reflective?\u201d Critics of Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2014 including some in his own party \u2014 have said that he makes racist statements, such as when he argued that a Hispanic judge is incapable of presiding fairly over a case involving Trump University. House Speaker Paul D.",
        "In the fall of 1997, Arianna Huffington and Dick Morris made a friendly wager. A year removed from advising Bill Clinton in his bid for a second term, Morris bet that Vice President Al Gore would win the next election, in 2000. Huffington, who was then a syndicated conservative columnist, bet that Gore would lose. \u201cThe winner gets dinner and, my money says, the deep pleasure of never having to say those frightening words: \u2018President Gore,\u2019 \u201d Huffington wrote at the time. Today, the ante seems pulled from an alternate universe, not merely another decade.",
        "A North Carolina country club turned into a fight club early Sunday morning after a brawl broke out that left one person dead and several others seriously injured. Deputies responded to the Lakewood Country Club, near Salemburg, N. C. about 2:30 a. m. Sunday after receiving multiple calls reporting gunshots and a fight at the clubhouse, according to the Sampson County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cResponding deputies discovered several groups fighting upon their arrival and attempted to break up the fights,\u201d a statement from the sheriff\u2019s office said. [Chuck E.",
        "RICHMOND \u2014 Only adults can get married in Virginia, according to a new law replacing policies that made it possible for a girl 13 or younger to marry if she had parental consent and was pregnant. The law, which took effect Friday, sets the minimum marriage age at 18, or 16 if a child is emancipated by court order. It takes parents and pregnancy out of the equation. The change is aimed at curbing forced marriage, human trafficking and statutory rape disguised as marriage.",
        "Mad about long lines? Take a number. More than 1 in 5 Americans will cancel their summer travel plans or find other means of transportation because of long airport lines, according to a recent study by the U. S. Travel Association (USTA) a trade group. The lines are lengthening for a number of reasons, including a seasonal influx of air travelers, heightened terrorism concerns and staffing shortages at the Transportation Security Administration. The prospect of facing a crowd at the airport is endlessly frustrating to travelers like Annette Kleier, a retired accountant from Louisville.",
        "It can feel like \u201ccoming out\u201d is everywhere \u2014 people talk about coming as every letter of the LGBTQ acronym, coming out with mental illness. The New York Times has noted that the Orlando massacre has inspired more people to come out as gay. But coming out usually isn\u2019t a singular pronouncement \u2014 an Ellen DeGeneres moment or a \u201cGlee\u201d moment. Instead, it\u2019s a series of moments. For Tia Bryan, a bisexual woman in Dallas, coming out is a process that happens every day.",
        "A few hours before she got ready for the CMT Music Awards this month, country music star Carrie Underwood hopped on the Periscope live video app for a quick Q&A with her fans. One question submitted from a viewer caught her eye: \u201cAre you pedaling?\u201d Underwood, who was visibly moving around in her seat on her tour bus, laughed. \u201cYes, I am. I\u2019ve got a little desk cycle,\u201d she said, pointing the camera down to show her sneakers strapped into the machine. \u201cI\u2019m really multitasking, trying to get a little workout in.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Three dozen union workers gathered outside city hall here on Thursday to rally against the global deals they believe have harmed Americans like them. Their candidate was Katie McGinty, the Democrats\u2019 nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania. But their spiritual leader was Republican Donald Trump. \u201cHe recognized there\u2019s some problems we need to solve,\u201d said McGinty, who is challenging Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R) a advocate. \u201cOne, we have to stop bad trade agreements. . . . And two, we have to take the Chinese on when they manipulate their currency and dump goods in our markets.",

        "BEIRUT \u2014 Suicide bombers suspected of links to the Islamic State struck for the fourth time in less than a week on Monday, targeting three locations in Saudi Arabia in an extension of what appeared to be a coordinated campaign of worldwide bombings coinciding with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Initial reports suggested there were relatively few casualties in the attacks at a U. S. consulate, a mosque frequented by Shiite worshippers and a security center in one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites, the historic city of Medina.",
        "The writer, a human rights activist and former political prisoner in the Soviet Union, is chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel. Perhaps better than anyone else of our age, Elie Wiesel grasped the terrible power of silence. He understood that the failure to speak out, about both the horrors of the past and the evils of the present, is one of the most effective ways there is to perpetuate suffering and empower those who inflict it. Wiesel therefore made it his life s mission to ensure that silence would not prevail.",
        "What shall we call the butterfly? The butterfly I have in mind is the one that illustrates chaos theory: It flutters its diaphanous wings, stirring the slightest breeze, which connects with others until, thousands of miles away, it forms the essential ingredient for a hurricane. Can we call this butterfly Brexit? I mean, why not? It qualifies.",
        "The culture wars are getting very, very expensive. Once upon a time, politicians could use wedge issues to score cheap political points, emphasis on \u201ccheap. \u201d Put a gay rights issue on the ballot, or pass an antiabortion bill, and you could turn out the base at prices. Even better, with minimal risk to the public fisc, you might be able to distract voters from other, thornier problems. Facing a public education crisis? Take a page from North Carolina, and pass a law regulating where and when people can pee.",
        "The Republican yearning to pin a scandal on Hillary Clinton knows no bounds. Any scandal will do, real or imagined. She must somehow be \u2014 or appear to be \u2014 guilty of something . They tried Benghazi. Boy, did they try Benghazi. House Republicans even put together a special committee, which Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy praised for hurting Clinton\u2019s chances of being elected president. \u201cEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\u201d he said in September. \u201cBut we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.",
        "In this odd political season \u2014 so shallow in rhetoric, so fundamental in consequence \u2014 Americans are not only celebrating their nation\u2019s independence, but they are also considering its meaning. All of a sudden, the most basic questions in our democracy are on the table: What is a real or good American? How do we define what is unique and great about our country? At least a portion of the current populist wave is a nationalist backlash against cosmopolitan elites.",
        "THE GOVERNMENT revealed Thursday that a Tesla Model S crashed into a truck in Florida in May, killing the electric car\u2019s driver. This, the headlines roared, is the first known example of a fatal road accident involving a car. Except it is not. The Tesla\u2019s \u201cAutopilot\u201d feature was turned on.

        "LONDON \u201d firebrand and populist politician Nigel Farage resigned as leader of his U. K. Independence Party on Monday, the latest political bombshell to hit Britain as it grapples with the fallout from last month s vote to leave the European Union. His resignation came as Conservative members of Parliament launched their own process to choose a new party leader and prime minister Monday night, holding a meeting for the top five candidates."
