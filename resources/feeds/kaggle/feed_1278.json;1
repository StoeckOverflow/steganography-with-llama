        "Take a break from your cookout tonight to look up at the sky and think of Juno. On Monday, the spacecraft will zip into Jupiter\u2019s orbit, allowing us to study the secrets of our solar system\u2019s biggest, oldest planet for the first time. Other spacecraft have visited Jupiter before. But Juno will orbit closer than any of them \u2014 within 2, 700 miles of the planet\u2019s cloud cover \u2014 and allow scientists to probe for data from beneath the giant planet\u2019s roiling, gassy surface.",
        "For the Clintons, things had been going a little too well of late. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, had blown his general election head start with a series of wounds that he seemed unable or unwilling to fix in anything like a timely manner. The Democratic Party had rapidly united behind Hillary Clinton, and polling suggested she had a edge over Trump. Then this past week happened.",
        "It\u2019s no secret that the Republican Party is split right now; while millions and millions of Republicans voted for the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, the party leadership is still wary of hitching its wagon to him, for fear of the consequences in 2016 and beyond. Some of them struggled to endorse Trump, coming up with halfhearted praise and a collective \u201dmeh.\u201d And now a whole group of party elites won\u2019t attend this month\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland, thinking that it would devolve into some kind of circus.",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey said Tuesday that his agency will not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server as secretary of state but called Clinton and her staff \u201cextremely careless\u201d in handling classified material. The announcement was stunning both for the level of detail Comey provided about an investigation that he ultimately believes should conclude without charges, and for the fact that the FBI director publicized his guidance before federal prosecutors had reached a final determination.",
        "Hillary Clinton may avoid criminal charges, but the searing rebuke of her \u201cextremely careless\u201d email practices Tuesday by FBI Director James B. Comey is likely to reverberate through the November election and, if she wins, well into her presidency. In a methodical, statement bringing an end to the FBI investigation of Clinton\u2019s personal email system while she was secretary of state, Comey laid bare a litany of facts that amounted to a stern admonishment of her judgment, management and stewardship of state secrets.",
        "Here\u2019s the good news for Hillary Clinton: The FBI has recommended that no charges be brought following its investigation of the former secretary of state\u2019s private email server. Here\u2019s the bad news: Just about everything else. FBI Director James B. Comey dismantled large portions of Clinton\u2019s story about her private server and what she sent or received on it during a stirring news conference, after which he took no questions. While Comey exonerated Clinton, legally speaking, he provided huge amounts of fodder that could badly hamstring her in the court of public opinion.",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey s remarks Tuesday about Hillary Clinton s email use while she was secretary of state directly contradicted much of what Clinton had said publicly about the issue.  Here s how Comey s statements stack up against Clinton s explanations.   Did Clinton send or receive classified material using her private setup?        FBI Director James Comey said on July 5 that Hillary Clinton should not be charged for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Here\u2019s what he said, in three minutes. (Peter   Washington Post)    What Clinton said:",
        "When FBI Director James B. Comey announced Tuesday that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges",
        "Law enforcement officials tend to inhabit a universe that is both binary and terse: prosecute or don\u2019t prosecute. Let the facts in the indictment speak for themselves. No further comment. So the remarks by FBI Director James B. Comey accompanying his announcement that he would not recommend bringing charges against former secretary of state Hillary Clinton were, as he acknowledged, \u201cunusual. \u201d Indeed, that word scarcely captures what happened. Comey\u2019s comments were an extraordinary, important and, on balance, justifiable departure from normal practice. Clinton may not be better off for them, but the country is.",
        "Perusing the wires on a deadline morn, I was struck by a constellation of intellectuals struggling to translate the relative meanings of Brexit, Donald Trump and the West\u2019s populist surge against elites. At least three bright fellows caught my eye: columnist Ross Douthat of the New York Times; Daniel Drezner, professor of international politics at Tufts University and a Post blogger; and New Yorker writer George Saunders. I\u2019m grateful to each for his contribution to this column. Studying the indigenous peoples is good fun, no doubt about it. I like to dabble now and then myself.",
        "FIRST, A to the investigator: In examining the use of a private email server for official business by of State Hillary Clinton, FBI Director James B. Comey appears to have navigated treacherous waters with the commitment to principle and rule of law that any citizen could wish for. The FBI investigated thoroughly. It came to its conclusion in time for voters to factor it into their deliberations. Mr. Comey leveled with the American people, reporting to them even before reporting to his own bosses.",
        "Here\u2019s what happened to Hillary Clinton on Tuesday: She learned that the FBI investigation into her emails would end without charges being filed. Her political opponents embarrassed themselves with hissy fits and tantrums. And the best campaigner in America fired up her supporters at a nationally televised rally in a crucial swing state. That\u2019s not a good day, it\u2019s a great day. All year, the question of Clinton\u2019s emails had hung over her presidential bid. Despite what her opponent, Sen.",
        "Jim Comey knows how to spin a yarn. Nine years ago, I sat in a Senate hearing room and watched Comey, the former No. 2 official in George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department, tell a tale worthy of Tom Clancy about how White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and Chief of Staff Andy Card staged a ambush of Attorney General John Ashcroft, who lay in intensive care at George Washington Hospital.",
        "In the global revulsion at the past week\u2019s terror attacks in four Muslim countries, the United States and its allies have a new opportunity to build a unified command against the Islamic State and other extremists. But as the U. S. seeks to broaden this alliance, it should be careful about partnering with Russia \u2014 unless Moscow distances itself from a Syrian regime that many Sunni Muslims despise. The savage attacks in Turkey, Bangladesh, Iraq and Saudi Arabia should convince Muslim nations and the West that they share a common enemy in extremist groups such as the Islamic State.",
        "School districts in the Washington area and across the country are adopting grading practices that make it more difficult for students to flunk classes, that give students opportunities to retake exams or turn in late work, and that discourage or prohibit teachers from giving out zeroes. The policies have stirred debates about the purpose of issuing academic grades and whether they should be used to punish, motivate or purely represent what students have learned in class.",
        "LONDON \u2014 It has been more than 13 years since British troops stormed their way through the Iraqi desert in a quest, alongside their American allies, to topple the dictator Saddam Hussein. It has been more than seven years since the last British combat troops lowered the Union Jack and withdrew, their prime minister hailing Iraq as a \u201csuccess story\u201d as they left. But it will not be until Wednesday that the British public gets what war critics say was owed long ago: an exhaustive account of how and why the U. K.",
        "After five years hurtling through space, NASA\u2019s Juno probe slipped into orbit around Jupiter, the biggest, oldest planet in our cosmic neighborhood, on the Fourth of July. As the world awoke Tuesday, scientists were abuzz with the possibility that the spacecraft would help us understand how our solar system and all its planets and even life itself came to be. The orbiter was traveling some 125, 000 mph as it closed in on the king of the planets.",
        "When Mohamed Bailor Jalloh walked into the Blue Ridge Arsenal gun store and indoor target range in Chantilly, Va. on Friday to purchase a Bushmaster rifle, he had no idea that his every move was being monitored by the FBI. Jalloh, 26, spent about 10 minutes in the shop before attempting to buy the assault weapon, but he was told that he did not have the required three forms of identification to make the purchase, said Earl Curtis, the store\u2019s owner. Jalloh told employees that he would return.",
        "For a number of years now, climate change skeptics have argued that there\u2019s a key part of the Earth\u2019s climate system that upends our expectations about global warming, and that is showing trends that actually cut in the opposite direction. This supposed contrary indicator is the sea ice that rings the Antarctic continent, and that reached a new record extent of 7. 78 million square miles in September 2014 (see above). As that record suggests, this vast field of ice has been expanding in recent years, rather than shrinking.",
        "CHARLOTTE \u2014 President Obama made his debut on the campaign trail Tuesday for Hillary Clinton, declaring himself \u201cready to pass the baton\u201d during a boisterous rally in this battleground state on a politically challenging day for his preferred successor. \u201cMy faith in Hillary Clinton has always been rewarded,\u201d Obama told an overflow crowd of thousands at the Charlotte Convention Center, where he heaped praise on his former secretary of state as she perched on the edge of a chair a few feet away.",
        "It\u2019s all just one big misunderstanding. If you\u2019re looking for a slogan for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, that may just do it. Tweeting a shape that looked like a red Star of David with $100 bills behind it? Not ! Misunderstanding \u2014 mixed with political crookedness!",
        "She was moody, vain and insecure. She berated her famous husband in public, went on shopping binges and made enemies. She was called \u201cthe hell cat\u201d by some of the staff at the White House. First lady Mary Todd Lincoln, who also experienced the deaths of three of her children and the assassination of her husband, was a troubled figure in American history. Later in life, she was temporarily institutionalized.",
        "Fireworks on television have one job: To be beautiful. So it\u2019s not exactly surprising that \u2014 when faced with the foggy, overcast weather in Washington on Monday night \u2014 producers of PBS\u2019s \u201cA Capitol Fourth\u201d concert and fireworks special edited the live broadcast to include stock footage of previously recorded fireworks, which showed a glorious display bursting in a clear sky. When viewers found out what they saw on TV didn\u2019t match what was happening on the National Mall, many of them did not take it well. But why are people so angry?",
        "My regulars walk into the bar like it\u2019s their living room. And in a lot of ways, it is. I\u2019ve worked in restaurants and bars for eight years, and each place had a loyal crowd who stopped by to eat or drink five or six nights a week. My last bar was a bistro with tin ceilings and leather banquettes. It had a great burger, nightly dinner specials and a seasonal cocktail menu, though my regulars usually preferred the classics: an ice cold gin martini or an Aperol spritz in the garden.",
        "(Klaus Pichler) \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink.

        "U. S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday confirmed that the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges. The announcement brings to a formal end a probe that for months dogged the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s campaign, though it is not particularly surprising. On Tuesday, FBI Director James B. Comey had said \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring a criminal case against Clinton or her staffers, even though investigators found \u201cevidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.",
        "Eric Trump, the son of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said in an interview Wednesday that his father gives \u201dmillions and millions and millions\u201d of his own money to charity \u2014 including hundreds of thousands to Eric Trump\u2019s own charitable foundation. After making that assertion, Eric Trump was asked if he would provide details of his father\u2019s gifts to the Eric Trump Foundation, to confirm that they really exist. Eric Trump said he would check. Several hours later, he wrote back. He would not.",
        "This post has been updated. Donald Trump raised more than $26 million through online and mail solicitations in June and another $25 million at events with the Republican National Committee, his campaign announced Wednesday, a hefty haul that his allies hope will put to rest anxieties in the party about his fundraising prowess. The combined $51 million falls short of the $68. 5 million that Democratic contender Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party collected in June, which included $40. 5 million she raised directly for her campaign.",
        "Officials in Baton Rouge moved quickly on Wednesday to quell national outrage at what is the latest in a string of fatal police encounters captured on video \u2014 the shooting of Alton Sterling, a black man. Sterling was shot and killed early Tuesday morning after police responded to a complaint about an armed man threatening people outside a convenience store. Cellphone video showing Sterling on the ground, underneath two officers, when he was killed, began circulating online early Tuesday evening. By the end of the night, the outrage was rippling nationwide.",
        "LONDON \u2014 A sweeping, inquiry into Britain\u2019s role in the Iraq War delivered a devastating assessment Wednesday, with investigators blaming the country\u2019s political, military and intelligence leadership for disastrously mismanaging a conflict that need never have started and that ended \u201ca very long way from success. \u201d The findings offer official validation to the views of the Iraq War\u2019s most ardent critics, forensically eviscerating in the sober language of the British civil service nearly every aspect of the conflict\u2019s conception, planning and execution."
