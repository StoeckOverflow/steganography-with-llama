        "Matthew Miller was director of the Justice Department\u2019s public affairs office from 2009 to 2011. When FBI Director James B. Comey stepped to the lectern to deliver his remarks about Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, he violated Justice Department practices for how such matters are to be handled, set a dangerous precedent for future investigations and committed a gross abuse of his own power. The emails are being screened and released in batches. Here are some things we\u2019ve learned from them. Caption Clinton has come under fire for using a private email address during her time as secretary of state.",
        "Bubaker Habib was a local contractor for the U. S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. The last time I saw my friend Chris Stevens was at the Benghazi Airport as his body was being transferred to the plane to begin his last journey back to the United States. The great, honorable, gentle man I welcomed to Benghazi only two days earlier now lay lifeless before me on the same tarmac. Chris had arrived in Benghazi on Sept. 10, 2012, for five days of meetings and to inaugurate an American cultural center at an school under my care.",
        "Politico reports that Bernie Sanders was booed by House Democrats in a private meeting today on Capitol Hill. Apparently they were irked with Sanders for withholding his endorsement of Clinton, and reacted badly after he said this: \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t to win elections. The goal is to transform America. \u201d One Dem even accused Sanders of \u201csquandering\u201d his movement. But if Sanders is squandering his movement, it is odd that he continues to rack up meaningful victories in the battle to transform the Democratic agenda, if not the country.",
        "Early Tuesday morning, two Baton Rouge police officers shot and killed Alton Sterling, a black man who was selling CDs outside of a convenience store. Cell phone video of the shooting shows Sterling seemingly incapacitated on the ground when one officer yelled, \u201cHe\u2019s got a gun!\u201d An officer \u2014 according to a witness, not the officer who shouted \u2014 then drew and fired his gun into Sterling\u2019s chest.

        "Overnight, we learned the name Alton Sterling. Thanks to a graphic video, we\u2019ve now seen his death at the hands of Baton Rouge police officers in a convenience store parking lot. Taken with a bystander\u2019s cellphone, the video shows Sterling being Tasered, thrown on a car and then on the ground, with police officers on top of him. It cuts away as multiple shots are heard, leaving Sterling\u2019s lifeless body on the ground. Sterling is one of 122 black Americans shot and killed by police so far in 2016, according to a Washington Post database of fatal police shootings.",
        "Behold the reluctant warrior. Five years and two weeks ago, President Obama addressed the nation about the end of the war in Afghanistan. There would be no more Americans in combat in Afghanistan in 2014, he said, vowing to match what he\u2019d already accomplished in Iraq. \u201cTonight, we take comfort in knowing that the tide of war is receding,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve ended our combat mission in Iraq, with 100, 000 American troops already out of that country.",
        "President Obama announced revised troop plans for Afghanistan on Wednesday, keeping 8, 400 U. S. troops in the country when he steps down early next year, the clearest indication yet of his inability to end the long war there. \u201cI strongly believe that it is in our national security interest, especially after all the blood and treasure we\u2019ve invested in Afghanistan over the years, that we give our Afghan partners the very best opportunity to succeed,\u201d Obama said in remarks at the White House. He had hoped to leave a force of 5, 500 in early 2017.",
        "Sen. Bob Corker ( .) the chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has recently emerged as a finalist in the search for Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, told The Washington Post in an interview Wednesday that he has taken himself out of consideration for the position. Corker said that he informed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee of his decision during their day together on Tuesday, when the senator had a series of meetings with campaign officials in New York and then flew with Trump to an evening rally in North Carolina.",
        "Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) will not attend the Republican National Convention this month, reversing previous plans and joining a growing list of vulnerable Republicans who have shied away from the event where the GOP is expected to officially nominate Donald Trump for president. In a statement explaining his decision, Rubio spokeswoman Olivia cited a need to campaign at home as the main reason. She made no mention of Trump. \u201cFlorida has always been a competitive state and it will be this fall,\u201d said in the statement issued Wednesday.",
        "Scott Walker wants to make one thing absolutely, crystal clear: He\u2019s supporting a human for president in the fall. Last August, I said I\u2019d support the GOP nominee. It\u2019s now clear who the RNC delegates will vote to nominate. And he is better than she is. \u2014 Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) July 6, 2016 Now, I am a highly trained political reporter, so let me do a bit of forensic analysis of this tweet.",

S. sailor in Navy SEAL training has been ruled a homicide, with a medical examiner in San Diego determining that a SEAL instructor dunked the sailor in a swimming pool at least twice despite prohibitions against doing so.

        "Chelsea Manning, the U. S. soldier sentenced to 35 years in prison for her role in the publication of a vast trove of classified information by the group WikiLeaks, was hospitalized early Tuesday after what media reports characterized as a suicide attempt. Manning, 28, was taken to the hospital and has since been returned to confinement, said Wayne Hall, an Army spokesman.

        "Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson has filed a lawsuit against the network\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Roger Ailes, alleging that he fired her in retaliation for rebuffing his sexual advances. Carlson, 50, who the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d morning program and later an afternoon news show on Fox, was dropped by the network June 23 when her contract expired.

        "NEW YORK \u2014 Groomed at some of the country\u2019s most elite private schools, Andrew Caspersen glided onto Wall Street with ease. His father was a financier, and Caspersen followed in his footsteps. He snagged jobs in the private equity world, earning a salary of more than $3. 68 million in 2015. So when Caspersen called friends and family members last year with an investment opportunity, no one, it seems, blinked an eye.

        "President Obama is having a banner dad week. First, he invoked the right to embarrass elder daughter Malia by diving into an version of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d at the White House\u2019s Fourth of July barbecue on Monday. Then on Tuesday, the president nonchalantly let slip that Sasha has a Twitter account, an apparently revelation that sent the world according to the Internet into a search engine frenzy. The birthday song didn\u2019t have the viral legs of Obama\u2019s 2012 Al Green impersonation. But the Twitter thing?",
        "It once seemed a quintessential American meal, even if it was, like so many of our more delicious foods, an import. But in the United States, pasta, cheap and delicious, has fallen on hard times recently. Lumped together with other carbohydrates fueling the obesity epidemic, villainized by the Atkins and paleo diets, and indeed declared a threat to a growing number of Americans with gluten allergies, pasta has seemed at risk at losing its prize spot on American dinner tables.",
        "Daniel Peabody loved his dogs. At least, that\u2019s the way it looked to students whenever Peabody, a hulking and heavily tattooed school cop, strode into northern Georgia classrooms with a at his side. The lieutenant loved his animal partners so much that when one dog retired, Peabody promptly adopted him. But Peabody wasn\u2019t the dog savior he portrayed himself to be, authorities say. Instead, the veteran officer now stands accused of leaving one police dog in a roasting car to die and executing another. Cherokee Co Schools Police Lt Daniel Peabody could face animal cruelty charges.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: Quotes have been edited for clarity. The Minangkabau are an anthropological wonder. The world\u2019s largest matrilineal society with a population the size of Los Angeles, its people sprawl through West Sumatra province in Indonesia. Despite producing numerous influential scholars and politicians, the Minangkabau have great trepidation about what urbanization means for its future. \u201cThe [urbanization] phenomenon is slowly destroying the identity of the Minangkabau,\u201d photographer Yoppy Pieter said.",

        "In the wake of a police shooting in a quiet St. Paul suburb that left a black driver dead, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton suggested that race played a role in the death of Philando Castile, a school cafeteria manager. \u201cWould this have happened if those passengers, the driver and the passengers, were white?\u201d said Dayton (D). \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have. So I\u2019m forced to confront, and I think all of us in Minnesota are forced to confront, that this kind of racism exists.",
        "President Obama added his voice Thursday to the national outrage over fatal police shootings of two African Americans this week, saying that \u201dall Americans should be deeply troubled\u201d by the incidents that are indicative of a \u201dserious problem\u201d of racial bias within the nation\u2019s criminal justice system.

        "Seconds after shooting the man he had just pulled over, the police officer yelled at a woman in the passenger seat: Ma am, keep your hands where they are. ? Diamond Lavish ? Reynolds watched blood drench her boyfriend s white shirt. She did not scream. She did not cry. Her language remained polite. I will, sir, ? she replied calmly. No worries. I will. ? Reynolds recorded the conversation on her phone, a routine traffic stop that turned deadly and caught the world s attention. As\u00c2 the officer shouted expletives, she continued to narrate with startling composure.",
        "Before he was fatally shot Wednesday by a police officer in Minnesota, before his name became a hashtag, Philando Castile was known as a warm and gentle presence at J. J. Hill Montessori Magnet School, where he managed the cafeteria. He was there when children streamed into school for breakfast in the morning, playing music and bantering. He was there when they returned for lunch: Laughing with kids, urging them to eat more vegetables, helping keep order in his easygoing way. And so it is difficult for anyone at J. J.",

        "Donald Trump came to Capitol Hill on Thursday to build and reinforce bridges with members of Congress less than two weeks before the Republican National Convention. Instead, he burned some to the ground. During a meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill, Trump admonished three of them who were not backing him as the presumptive GOP nominee. He characterized Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois as a loser and singled out Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska for opposing him, according to officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges. The sharpest confrontation came with Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona.",
        "Republican legislators on Thursday launched a new bid to scrutinize Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, questioning the FBI director for nearly five hours about how \u2014 after a investigation that found Clinton\u2019s setup to be problematic \u2014 he came to believe the matter should be closed with no criminal charges. The hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee previews what is likely to be a effort to call the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s credibility and judgment into question.",
        "Why did he do it? FBI Director James Comey spent 14 minutes laying out an unassailable case for prosecuting Hillary Clinton for the mishandling of classified material. Then at literally the last minute, he recommended against prosecution. This is baffling. Under the statute (18 U. S. C. section 793( f)) it\u2019s a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or \u201cthrough gross negligence. \u201d The evidence, as outlined by Comey, is overwhelming. Clinton either sent or received 110 emails in 52 chains containing material that was classified at the time.",
        "Donald Trump has advertised that he plans to bring back winning. America will win so much, he says, that we\u2019ll get \u201ctired of winning . \u201d But that\u2019s not what Americans need from our political leadership right now. We need someone who can bring back losing. Specifically: the art of losing graciously.

Late 20s, in good health, has a great job, just moved states. He\u2019s fine \u2014 for now. The feeling of \u201cfor now\u201d is new. I\u2019m a black woman living in the United States of America, but I didn\u2019t grow up with a pervasive sense of fear. I was taught that things were getting better \u2014 they\u2019re always getting better. Look, we\u2019ve moved past slavery, past Jim Crow. The civil rights movement worked!"
