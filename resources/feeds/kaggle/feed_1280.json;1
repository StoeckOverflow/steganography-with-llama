        "Donald Trump asked House Republicans Thursday to only \u201csay great things\u201d about him in an effort to project a unified front in the presidential election. Republican members of Congress repeatedly pressed Trump during their meeting to reassure them he would work with them constructively and respect their agenda if elected. Trump promised that he would and also repeatedly urged them to exit the meeting and tell the media outside that everything was perfect inside the Republican Party. \u201cIt would great if you could say we had an unbelievable meeting. \u2018Trump loves us.",

        "GARY JOHNSON and William Weld, the Libertarian Party nominees for president and vice president, respectively, brought their fiscally conservative, socially tolerant message to an interview with us Thursday morning. In some areas, their honesty and resistance to polish have a certain bracing appeal. Mr. Johnson had no apparent qualms about calling for some politically dicey policies, such as raising the Social Security retirement age to \u201cat least 70\u201d and encouraging government programs that would test heroin quality in order to reduce the number of overdose deaths. He and Mr.",
        "LONDON \u2014 The race to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister was whittled to two on Thursday, with Conservative Party lawmakers ensuring that the country will have a female head of government \u2014 the nation\u2019s first since Margaret Thatcher stepped down more than a ago. The contest will pit the home affairs secretary, Theresa May, against Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom in a race that features contenders who were on opposite sides of last month\u2019s European Union referendum. In a vote among 330 Tory members of Parliament, May was on top, with 199 votes, compared with 84 for Leadsom.",
        "Titan, Saturn\u2019s aptly named largest moon, is exactly the kind of place we want to visit: NASA describes it as \u201done of the most worlds we have found to date.\u201d It has a dense atmosphere and stable lakes and rivers. Its air isn\u2019t breathable (it\u2019s almost entirely nitrogen, with a little methane thrown in instead of oxygen) and its rivers, lakes and oceans are full of liquid methane and ethane. And at Fahrenheit, it\u2019s way too cold for a human to chill on.",
        "For political junkies, there is truly no greater time to be alive. The Internet allowed us to cancel our subscriptions \u2014 how did we ever wait 24 hours between doses? \u2014 and get news and commentary on an hourly IV drip. Cable TV banished those bleak days when we once yearned for the weekend (Honey, \u201cMeet the Press\u201d is on!) by offering up punditry panels, constantly refreshed like an eat buffet, or at least reheated under the lights.",
        "NORRISTOWN, PA. \u2014 A Pennsylvania judge refused to dismiss criminal charges against Bill Cosby on Thursday, dealing another legal blow to the legendary entertainer and pushing his sexual assault case closer to a trial. Cosby\u2019s attorneys had mounted a vigorous attempt to scuttle the prosecution case, arguing that the comedian had been deprived of his constitutional right to confront his accuser during a preliminary hearing last month. That hearing ended with a magistrate ordering Cosby to stand trial, although a date has not yet been set. Judge Steven T.",
        "Bernie Sanders is preparing to endorse Hillary Clinton for president as early as Tuesday at an event in New Hampshire, according to several Democrats familiar with the plans. The backing of Clinton from the in the Democratic nominating contest will follow weeks of maneuvering by Sanders to extract policy concessions on issues including college tuition and health care. The Clinton campaign has announced a campaign stop Tuesday in New Hampshire, a battleground state, but provided no details about the event.",
        "Jon Jones denied taking drugs at a highly emotional press conference on Thursday that saw the fighter briefly walk out after breaking down in tears. \u201cI\u2019ve been so outspoken about being against any type of performance enhancer. I\u2019m still to this day against any type of performance enhancer. Being labeled as someone who would cheat hurts me more than anything else I\u2019ve ever been through in my career,\u201d Jones said after apologizing to the fans, UFC staff and his opponent Daniel Cormier.",
        "Tamara Crowchief may have yelled \u201dI hate white people\u201d as she carried out a violent assault on a white person, but that doesn\u2019t mean her attack was racially motivated, a Canadian judge has ruled. The attack occurred outside a pub in Calgary, Canada, on Nov. 1, according to the Calgary Herald. Crowchief\u2019s victim, identified as Lydia White, lost a tooth in the assault, the paper reported. Prosecutor Karuna Ramakrishnan had tried to put Crowchief behind bars for 12 to 15 months by arguing that the indigenous woman\u2019s \u201dunprovoked\u201d actions represented a hate crime, the paper reported.",
        "DALLAS \u2014 Five Dallas police officers were killed and seven others wounded Thursday night when sniper fire turned a peaceful protest over recent police shootings into a scene of chaos and terror. The gunfire was followed by a standoff that lasted for hours with a suspect who told authorities \u201che was upset about the recent police shootings\u201d and \u201csaid he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers,\u201d according to Dallas Police Chief David Brown. The gunman was killed when police detonated a robot. After the bloodshed \u2014 the deadliest single day for law enforcement officers since the Sept.",
        "The man who died in a confrontation with police after he \u2014 and possibly others \u2014 carried out an attack that left five law enforcement officers in Dallas dead and several others wounded was a former member of an Army engineering company who was still technically affiliated with the military, records show. Micah X.",
        "A standoff between police and one of the suspects in a Dallas shooting spree, which left at least five police officers dead and seven others wounded Thursday night, ended after the suspect was killed when a robot delivered and detonated explosives where he was holed up, according to local law enforcement officials. The move represents a potentially unprecedented use of robots to deliberately deliver lethal force in domestic policing, according to experts, raising questions about how local law enforcement officials are deploying the tools that increasingly fill their arsenals.",
        "It was hard to miss Lorne Ahrens, in uniform or out. The former football player could turn heads just by showing up, according to his Charlie Buckingham. \u201cHe was a big ol\u2019 boy,\u201d Buckingham said Friday, the day after Ahrens was killed in the sniper attack on Dallas police officers. \u201cBig as he is, just walking down the street he cut a real figure. I\u2019m sure it helped him in his work. \u201d Buckingham had been watching the events in downtown Dallas unfold from his home in Burleson, Tex.",
        "It had been 12 hours since he\u2019d lost his son to one of the country\u2019s worst mass police shootings, and he still couldn\u2019t understand why. Dallas police officer Patrick Zamarripa, 32, had survived three tours in Iraq, one of the world\u2019s most dangerous places, his father, Rick Zamarripa, said Friday. And then this. \u201cHe comes to the United States to protect people here,\u201d his dad said. \u201cAnd they take his life. \u201d Rick was watching television Thursday night when news broke that someone had opened fire in downtown Dallas around 9 p. m.",
        "He d worked difficult jobs, waited for years and moved more than 1, 000 miles, but finally the day had come: Michael Krol was officially\u00c2 a cop. He stood there before the cameras, goofy grin and all, as his Michigan family crowded around to watch him hoist a certificate saying he had graduated from the Dallas Police Academy. It was April 25, 2008. Krol, then 32, still had a cherub face. And he seemed to have a long career ahead of him.",
        "When Brent Thompson saw you in church, said Sandra Hughes, he\u2019d wrap you in a hug. When his children were in Hughes\u2019s classroom, he\u2019d ask how he could help, and what he could do. And when he became a grandfather, Hughes said, he \u201cjust lived for those little kids. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s just was an incredible guy,\u201d said Hughes, a retired teacher in Texas. \u201cAnd I know those are words that describe everybody.",
        "Few people understand loss better than David Brown, the Dallas police chief who stood before television cameras Friday morning and said, \u201cWe are heartbroken. \u201d Even before five police officers were killed Thursday at the site of a Black Lives Matter protest where seven other people were wounded, Brown had become familiar with grief, pummeled by it again and again in his career and personal life. Before this week, violence had already taken from him a former partner, a brother, a son.",
        "This was to have been a celebratory month, a time when the two major political parties nominate their presidential candidates amid pageantry and expressions of optimism and unity. Instead, July has begun with violence of the worst kind, and with shock and horror and an escalation of racial tensions. Summer 2016 threatens to be long and divisive. The horrific killing Thursday night of five police officers in Dallas, and the earlier killings of individual African Americans by officers in Baton Rouge and Falcon Heights, Minn.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Last night, snipers killed five police officers and wounded seven others at an otherwise peaceful rally protesting recent police shootings. Not much is known about the attackers, but at a presser this morning, the Dallas police chief said one attacker had indicated during a standoff that \u201che said he was upset about the recent police shootings,\u201d and that \u201cthe suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.",
        "Without a doubt, we Americans are in a bad way. The senseless deaths this week in Baton Rouge, La. Falcon Heights, Minn. and now Dallas are devastating beyond comprehension for the victims and their families. Each shooting is also an act in a shared national tragedy. The problems go down to the very roots. The question of whether as a country we are headed in the right or wrong direction can no longer be answered simply with reference to policy matters such as the economy, education or foreign relations.",
        "When an awful event like the shooting of police officers in Dallas happens, we inevitably yearn for leaders who will bring us together, bind up the nation\u2019s wounds, unite us all in common understanding and common purpose. And when they don\u2019t, we\u2019re disappointed and decide that a different individual, perhaps like a politician we admired from our youth \u2014 Ronald Reagan, Bobby Kennedy, Franklin Roosevelt \u2014 could have succeeded where they failed. Barack Obama is already getting that criticism, and it will surely increase in the days to come.",
        "When it comes to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Republicans seem to have reached a point where they have agreed to disagree. A month ago, there was pressure for all Republicans to get behind Trump. No more. This equilibrium has been developing for some time, but yesterday\u2019s meetings between Trump and GOP members of the House and the Senate have solidified the political landscape for Republicans. Members such as Sen. Jeff Flake ( .) reportedly pushed Trump on changing his language and tone, while Rep. Mark Sanford ( . C.) questioned Trump\u2019s fundamental knowledge of government.",
        "Black lives matter. Blue lives matter. Both statements must be made true if the heartbreaking loss of life in Dallas is to have any meaning. The killing spree that left five police officers dead and seven others wounded should be classified as an act of domestic terrorism. The shooter, identified as Micah Xavier Johnson, apparently believed he was committing an act of political violence. Our duty, to honor the fallen, is to ensure that Johnson\u2019s vile and cowardly act has the opposite impact from what he sought.",
        "In a stunning lawsuit filed on Wednesday, former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson accused her inimitable Fox News chief Roger Ailes, of the vilest things. Like hitting on her in the office; asking her to turn around, the better to check out her \u201cposterior\u201d; and retaliating against her for refusing to play along. Carlson was terminated on June 23. Everyone saw the response from Ailes, which Fox News distributed Wednesday evening: Gretchen Carlson\u2019s allegations are false.",
        "U. S. health officials confirmed Friday that a Utah resident\u2019s death late last month was the first death in the continental United States. The Salt Lake County health department said the elderly person had an underlying health condition. The individual, who had traveled to a region this year, tested positive for the virus, the department said in a statement. The exact cause of death has not been determined, however. \u201dWe know [Zika] contributed to the death, but we don\u2019t know if it was the sole cause,\u201d medical officer Dagmar Vitek said in a news conference.",
        "Ten additional states are suing the Obama administration to stop a directive that requires schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms aligned with their gender identity under the threat of losing federal funding, bringing the total number of states challenging the guidance to 21.

The state is joined by nine others: Arkansas, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota and Wyoming.",
        "This morning, Donald Trump released a very statement on the tragedy in Dallas. The six paragraphs include no reference to the potential political motives of those who killed five police officers and injured seven more. He doesn\u2019t suggest that rhetoric could have caused such violence, as he has before. And he doesn\u2019t boast about having predicted that such an event would occur, as he did after the mass shooting in Orlando last month.",
        "Following the mass shooting in Dallas and killing of five law enforcement officers, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign reached out to the New York Police Department on Friday morning and asked whether he could address police officers at the Midtown North Precinct during 3 p. m. roll call, according to the New York Daily News. The campaign was firmly turned down \u2014 and Bill Bratton, the police commissioner, explained why during a news conference in New York.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s vigorous defense of an image widely regarded as has alarmed many Jewish Americans, who are growing increasingly fearful that someone who could be the next president is willing to stoke the kinds of stereotypical attacks that have haunted Jews around the world for generations. Rabbis and other Jewish community leaders point to a moment of reckoning following a Wednesday night appearance in which Trump, with his voice raised, defended the use of a star, which resembled the Star of David, mounted over a pile of $100 bills as part of an attack against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton."
