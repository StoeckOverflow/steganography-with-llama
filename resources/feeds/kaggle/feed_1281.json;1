But you\u2019d need a comprehensive scorecard to keep track of all the carnage since among those who led the charge for Brexit. The betrayals and the backstabbing. The revenge and the retribution. With chilling efficiency, the main players in the drive for an exit have now themselves been forced to take their leave.",
