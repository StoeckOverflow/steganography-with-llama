        "While pocketing $1. 3 billion in annual U. S. military aid, the Egyptian government of Abdel Fatah is waging war against what it describes as an plot to divide and destroy the country. The Obama administration\u2019s response to this vicious campaign, which has included prosecuting U. S. nongovernmental organization in Cairo and seeding the state media with poisonous propaganda, is to pretend that it isn\u2019t happening. Case in point: the American citizen Aya Hijazi of Alexandria, Va. Hijazi (sometimes spelled Hegazi) 29, has been imprisoned in Cairo without trial since May 2, 2014 \u2014 801 days as of Monday.",
        "The writer is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010. It is clear after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the Republican presidential primaries that electorates are revolting against the relatively open economic policies that have been the norm in the United States and Britain since World War II.",
        "Few technological breakthroughs have had the social and economic impact of the automobile. It changed America\u2019s geography, spawning suburbs, shopping malls and sprawl as far as the eye could see. It redefined how we work and play, from the daily commute to the weekend trek to the beach. It expanded the heavy industry \u2014 car production \u2014 that made the Midwest the economy\u2019s epicenter for decades. And, finally but not least, the car became the quintessential symbol of American mobility, status and independence.",
        "MEMBERS OF Congress, in case you missed it: Florida health officials confirmed on July 1 the largest count of people with new infections of the Zika virus, 10 on that day. Then, on July 6, 11 new cases. In all, at least 263 people in Florida have been infected since January, of which 43 have been pregnant women. In the United States, there are now 1, 133 people who have been infected, including 320 pregnant women.",
        "Hillary Clinton and her allies think that the political and legal cloud that hovered over her presidential prospects for more than a year blew away last week with news that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges in her handling of sensitive emails. Her Republican opponents say the cloud is as thick as ever \u2014 and every bit as useful as a political weapon against her. \u201cI am certainly relieved and glad that the investigation has concluded.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 Wen Tao has been saying what he thinks on China\u2019s booming outlets for the best part of a decade. His forthright views have won him tens of thousands of followers, but his criticism of the authorities has also come at a cost: He says his accounts have been closed down about 20 times, and he has been bombarded with curses, personal insults and death threats from other users. China\u2019s Communist Party and its military say they are waging an ideological war against hostile Western ideas on the Internet, and people like Wen are in the firing line.",
        "During his visit to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Donald Trump\u2019s political director, Jim Murphy, let a group of representatives in on a little secret. According to the Wall Street Journal, Murphy said that the campaign would focus on the states on the map below. (Created with our nifty electoral college mapmaker; go play with it.) Seventeen states is a lot. If your math isn\u2019t super great or you can\u2019t be bothered to do the calculation, that\u2019s about a third of the country. Combined, the states are worth 208 electoral votes.",
        "You can love Donald Trump. You can hate him. But what you cannot dispute is that the way he has run his campaign since sealing the Republican nomination two months ago has been absolutely disastrous. Campaigns are complicated things. No one gets every piece of them right. Some candidates are great at big rallies. Some are good only at small events. Some are terrific TV communicators but bad on the stump. Some delegate well, and others don\u2019t. Some never waver from a message, while others can\u2019t seem to find one with a pole.",
        "WARSAW \u2014 Amid fears of a rollback of Poland\u2019s democratic freedoms, President Obama had a harsh message of concern during a trip here for a NATO summit. But viewers of Poland\u2019s main evening news program saw exactly the opposite. The twisted message would not instill confidence in the new Polish government\u2019s protestations that its media institutions remain independent. Add one more fear to U. S. concerns that a major ally is turning in a new direction after the Law and Justice party won a sweeping victory in October.",
        "Some Pokemon Go players ended up caught by armed robbers in their quest to catch \u2019em all, according to a Missouri police department. The game, which was released last week to so much fanfare that its servers were regularly overloaded, allows players to catch cute digital critters via a smartphone app by exploring locations. But some criminals \u2014 no doubt fans of the villainous Team Rocket \u2014 appear to have used the game\u2019s mechanics for evil: In a Facebook post Sunday, police in O\u2019Fallon, Mo.",
        "Geoff Farrar was beaten to death with a hammer on Dec. 28, 2013, at Carderock, which is a series of cliffs frequented by rock climbers along the Maryland side of the Potomac River. Farrar was a climber. Some people called him Carderock Geoff because he was a constant presence at the rocks, like the sycamores and brambles growing in the bottoms. He was found bleeding badly from head wounds at the base of a route called Cripple\u2019s Traverse. An ambulance from Montgomery County showed up first. Next came a pair of county rescue boats.",
        "You\u2019ve heard of the accidental tourist. Now we have the reluctant news media. I\u2019m talking about Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, among others. With the advent of options \u2014 Facebook Live and Periscope, primarily \u2014 their already huge influence in the news universe has taken another stunning leap. When Diamond Reynolds logged on to Facebook after her boyfriend, Philando Castile, was shot by a police officer Wednesday in Falcon Heights, Minn. her first words as she started recording were \u201cStay with me. \u201d Millions did.",
        "Ah, the heart of summer. With the July 4 weekend approaching fast, it\u2019s time to hit the open road or simply go outside and enjoy the dog days in your own back yard. We\u2019ve collected some apps that can help keep your summertime adventures rolling no matter what your style. Feel free to mix and match. Just keep that smartphone out of the sun.

        "Late last year, my husband and I joined the ranks of the . With our purchase of a house, we traded our status as lackadaisical renters for that of homeowners, regarding the invasive shoots of bamboo at the back fence with a gimlet eye, believing each one an existential threat. For decades a committed I\u2019m now forced to admit that Cersei Lannister greets her royal children\u2019s fiancees with more warmth than I greet these graceful stalks of green.",
        "LONDON \u2014 The politics of Britain\u2019s endlessly unpredictable summer took another stunning twist on Monday, with the selection by default of a prime minister who had advocated staying in the European Union but will now come under immediate pressure to fulfill her promise to lead the nation\u2019s exit. Theresa May, the home affairs secretary, was elevated to Britain\u2019s top job when the woman who was to spend the summer campaigning against her, Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, preemptively dropped out of the contest to succeed outgoing leader David Cameron.",
        "Unlike many of her Supreme Court colleagues, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has never been shy about granting news interviews and speaking her mind when she does so. It\u2019s made her the fierce\u201cNotorious RBG\u201d to her young, feminist fans and a scourge to conservatives who say her musings are inappropriate and could be disqualifying in future cases. But she went even further than usual last week in her comments to the Associated Press and The New York Times about presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.",
        "Two bailiffs were killed and a deputy sheriff wounded in a shooting Monday afternoon at a courthouse in Berrien County, Mich. authorities said. The gunman was also killed. The Berrien County sheriff did not go into detail about the nature of the incident, saying only that there was \u201ca disturbance\u201d on the courthouse\u2019s third floor shortly before 2:30 p. m. \u201cWe don\u2019t have all the details as to what happened or whatever occurred or how he got the weapon,\u201d Sheriff L. Paul Bailey said at a news conference Monday. \u201cThe suspect has been shot and killed,\u201d he said.",
        "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 In a coffeehouse with the world\u2019s tallest building preening from two miles out the front window, here sits another groundbreaker: a female, Emirati, Arab, Muslim, competitive weightlifter with a vitality in her tone, a hijab on her head and a herniated disk hollering from her lower back. Not so long ago, Amna Al Haddad never would have guessed she would reach the spring of 2016 speaking in enthusiastic paragraphs about her unforeseen odyssey.",
        "DALLAS \u2014 The police chief here said Monday he feels that law enforcement officers across the country are being asked to take on too much, comments that came as his department was still investigating the mass shooting of Dallas police officers last week and protesters in other cities continued demonstrations against how officers use force.",
        "Dylan Noble died on the last Saturday of June. Police in Fresno, Calif. received a report of a man walking a downtown street with a rifle, but when they arrived, they instead found Noble speeding by in his pickup truck. When they tried to pull him over, the led police to a nearby gas station and then exited his car. \u201cThe driver then turned towards officers with one hand concealed behind his back, and told officers he hated his life,\u201d the Fresno police department said in a statement. \u201cAs he continued to advance towards officers, an shooting occurred.",
        "On April 4, 1968 \u2014 the day that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed by a sniper \u2014 Robert Kennedy gave (arguably) one of the greatest American speeches not given by a president. Speaking in a tough section of Indianapolis, Kennedy informed the shocked crowd that King was dead, quoted Aeschylus on the wisdom that comes \u201cdrop by drop\u201d from pain, and set out the ideal of a politics that could \u201cmake gentle the life of this world.",
        "Still waiting for your elusive but raise? At long last, it seems to be just around the corner. And that bodes well not just for millions of regular Americans, but also for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The U. S. economy gets a bad rap these days, despite the fact that it\u2019s doing better than almost every other economy that went through a financial crisis in . With very low unemployment and historically low inflation, we\u2019re in the midst of . Which in theory should feel pretty good. Still, U. S. politicians \u2014 and especially U. S.",
        "Well, it looks as though there might be a rebellion at the Republican national convention after all. No, delegates are not going to rise up and deny the GOP nomination to Donald Trump in favor of some candidate. But if Trump decides to nominate a Democrat as his vice presidential nominee, convention delegates could rebel and reject Trump\u2019s choice. The candidate in question is retired lieutenant general Michael T. Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.",
        "THE SOLUTION to a bad guy with a gun, it is often said, is a good guy with a gun. Yet according to Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) there were 20 to 30 good guys openly carrying guns among the protesters whom Dallas police were supervising last Thursday night, when Micah Xavier Johnson began picking off officers. \u201cIn the middle of a firefight,\u201d the mayor said Sunday, \u201cit\u2019s hard to pick out the good guys and the bad guys. \u201d In fact, the presence of so many guns could have made Thursday\u2019s massacre worse.",
        "BAGHDAD \u2014 Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said Monday that the Pentagon will deploy an additional 560 U. S. troops to Iraq, widening the U. S. military campaign against the Islamic State after Iraqi security forces seized a key airfield over the weekend. Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, the top U.

        "In a new study published in Nature on Monday, scientists say they have for the first time thoroughly documented one of the most profound planetary changes yet to be caused by a warming climate: The distribution of clouds all across the Earth has shifted, they say. And moreover, it has shifted in such a way \u2014 by expanding subtropical dry zones, located between around 20 and 30 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, and by raising cloud tops \u2014 as to make global warming worse.",
        "PORTSMOUTH, N. H. \u2014 When Bernie Sanders finally offers his endorsement of Hillary Clinton here on Tuesday, it will be the culmination of a month of aggressive courting by her, including a meeting in Washington and a dinner between their campaign managers in Vermont. But much remains unknown about how \u2014 and whether \u2014 the political marriage being unveiled Tuesday will actually work. While they have a common enemy in Republican Donald Trump, Clinton and Sanders don\u2019t have much of a personal or professional relationship. And many of their supporters remain deeply suspicious of the other candidate.",
        "A majority of Americans reject the FBI\u2019s recommendation against charging Hillary Clinton with a crime for her State Department practices and say the issue raises concerns about how she might perform her presidential duties, according to a new Washington News poll. Six in 10 voters say the outcome will have no impact on their vote this November, even as those who do largely say it discourages them from backing the presumptive Democratic nominee. Last week\u2019s decision by FBI Director James B.",
        "Donald Trump cast the presidential race as a sort of athletic contest in a Monday interview with The Fix, insisting he has a history of performing under pressure while Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, withers under that sort of scrutiny. \u201dShe is highly overrated in the brains department,\u201d Trump said of Clinton. \u201dShe is really bad at reacting under pressure.\u201d Of himself, Trump said \u201dI was always a good athlete,\u201d adding: \u201dUnder pressure, some good athletes become bad athletes\u201d referring to Clinton.",
