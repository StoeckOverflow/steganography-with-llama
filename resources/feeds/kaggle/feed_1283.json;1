        "Early Friday morning, Shayla Wiggins hopped a fence to walk along the bank of Wind River in Riverton, Wyo. She was looking for Pok\u00e9mon, the collectible cartoon critters that debuted in Japan in 1996 and won the hearts of every since. What Wiggins found instead would reduce her to tears and spark a police investigation. A week before her discovery, Wiggins\u2019s search for Pok\u00e9mon along the Wind River would have been met with concern or ridicule. But the world \u2014 or, so far Australia, New Zealand and the United States \u2014 changed Wednesday. That\u2019s thanks to Pok\u00e9mon Go.",
        "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 A photo posted by Britany LaManna (@britmaack) on Jul 5, 2016 at 12:11pm PDT What cringeworthy thing are Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston going to do next? Over the last three weeks, the question has struck fear and fascination into the hearts of Swift and Hiddleston fans and celebrity onlookers as the stars have embarked on a very photographed international tour of love. It might be real, it might be a publicity stunt, it might be performance art. It\u2019s definitely hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away.",
        "Ania in her room that she shares with two other girls. \u201cI actually had no idea that they photoshopped the models in magazines or that people from Hollywood often had had plastic surgery,\u201d she said. (Marie ) An eating disorder is the third most common ailment among teenagers. Worldwide, one out of five teens suffers from an eating disorder, such as anorexia and bulimia, which eventually can lead to heart failure and a malfunction of the internal organs, causing death.",
        "DALLAS \u2014 President Obama sought to unify a nation left divided and raw by recent fatal shootings involving police officers, speaking Tuesday at a memorial service for five officers killed here and calling for understanding from both law enforcement and those protesting against them.",
        "Out of all America\u2019s skyjackings, only one remains unsolved. The case has confounded FBI investigators for decades \u2014 its astonishing details, clues and alleged participants have become the stuff of American criminal lore. The story has inspired songs, and books, and the main character has, at times, bordered on American folk hero status. Now, after one of \u201cthe longest and most exhaustive investigations\u201d in FBI history, the agency is finally moving on from the search for the notorious skyjacker known as D. B. Cooper, according to a statement released by the FBI.",
        "PORTSMOUTH, N. H. \u2014 Bernie Sanders pledged to support presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at a boisterous but at times awkward rally here Tuesday, more than a month after Clinton effectively clinched the nomination. \u201cShe will be the Democratic nominee for president, and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States,\u201d the senator from Vermont said in this battleground state, where the former rivals appeared side by side on a stage in a packed high school gym.",
        "For weeks, The Washington Post has been trying to prove Donald Trump right about something: The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s claim that he has given millions of dollars to charity, directly out of his own pocket. But proof has been hard to find. Public records show no gifts from Trump to his own namesake charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, since 2008.",
        "U. S. stock markets climbed to new record highs on Tuesday, capping off three days of gains and sending the Nasdaq index into positive territory for the year. The daily gain was modest, with major indices rising by less than 1 percent, but the move was enough to push the markets above their previous records. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 121 points, or 0. 7 percent, to close at 18347. The Standard & Poor\u2019\u2019s index increased by 0. 7 percent to 2, 152, topping the high reached Monday.",
        "NOTHING SUPREME Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said in recent interviews about the presidential election should surprise anyone familiar with her biography and her career on the court. A lifelong lawyer and feminist innovator who was appointed to the high court by President Bill Clinton in 1993, the Justice Ginsburg fits the profile of a Hillary Clinton supporter to a T. Obviously, she would rather have a Democrat appointing her next new colleague, and possibly her replacement.",
        "If Spoiler Alerts has had a theme for 2016, it\u2019s been that Donald Trump is massively unfit to be president, and that his campaign has challenged all sorts of norms that have mattered in American politics for quite some time. In other words, Spoiler Alerts thinks that candidate Trump has made America worse again, and a President Trump would make America bankrupt again. What\u2019s beginning to concern me just as much as Trump, however, is how other figures of authority are responding to him.",
        "Sometimes, political candidates wear sandwich boards. They are so obvious about the political tactic they are pursuing that they might as well just read the strategy memo that went into their decision and cite the polling numbers that told them it would be a winner. So it was with Donald Trump\u2019s entirely unsubtle declaration in Virginia on Monday: \u201cI am the law and order candidate.",
        "Three months ago, before Britain descended into its \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d madness, Theresa May delivered a speech on her country\u2019s place in Europe \u2014 on sovereignty, prosperity and the dilemma of a midsize nation in an era of globalization. Unlike those campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union, she wielded real statistics, not fake ones. Unlike many \u201cremainers,\u201d she stressed the attractions of escape from certain European institutions while robustly defending others. She was thoughtful, principled and intelligently aware of history, pronouncing herself a Euroskeptic who nonetheless believed in staying in the union.",
        "In 2014, a man testified that Penn State football coach Joe Paterno ignored his complaints of a sexual assault committed by assistant coach Jerry Sandusky in 1976 when the man was a boy, according to court documents unsealed Tuesday in a Philadelphia court. Four other former assistant football coaches at the school also were aware of Sandusky acting inappropriately with boys before law enforcement was first notified in 1998, according to testimony contained in the documents.",
        "The unusual and apparently unprecedented battle of words between a justice of the Supreme Court and a presumptive presidential nominee continued Tuesday. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made clear that her criticism of Republican Donald Trump was not the result of an unguarded moment. She told a CNN analyst in an interview late Monday that Trump was a \u201cfaker\u201d and said she was surprised the media has not pressed him more to release his tax returns.",
        "Almost everywhere you turn, it seems, people have their eyes glued to smartphone screens playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. Since its launch last week, the app has quickly become a cultural phenomenon that has fans of all ages hunting around their neighborhoods for collectible digital creatures that appear on players\u2019 screens as they explore locations. But there\u2019s at least one place that would really like to keep Pok\u00e9mon out: the Holocaust Museum. The museum, along with many other landmarks, is a \u201dPok\u00e9Stop\u201d within the game \u2014 a place where players can get free items.",
        "BEIJING  \u201d China s expansive assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea suffered a major blow Tuesday when an international tribunal ruled that its claims have no legal or historical basis, throwing up the possibility of a new period of tension and confrontation in the region. Beijing fiercely rejected the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which sided unequivocally with the Philippines against China. The United States urged calm.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 It was a heroic and straightforward story, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. It also wasn\u2019t true, say military analysts and news reports. Two Russian pilots were killed Friday in Syria when a Syrian helicopter was shot down by the Islamic State near the city of Palmyra, the ministry said. The pilots were on a training mission when they received an urgent request to fight off an Islamic State offensive that threatened to capture an important, elevated position nearby.",
        "The leader of a polygamous Utah sect came up with a simple but slippery way to escape law enforcement late last month: olive oil. Lyle Jeffs, the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (also known as FLDS) was initially being held in jail after federal authorities arrested him and 10 other church leaders over a case earlier this year. Despite pleas from federal prosecutors and estranged family members who warned that Jeffs would escape, U. S.",
        "Fox News Channel said Tuesday that it has suspended its agreement with contributor Newt Gingrich due to \u201cintense media speculation\u201d about Gingrich\u2019s possible selection as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. The cable news channel said the suspension \u2014 typical in cases in which an contributor is running for office or considering it \u2014 was mutually agreed upon. Fox previously suspended its agreement with Gingrich in 2011 when he ran for the Republican presidential nomination. Gingrich, the former House speaker, has been prominently mentioned as a potential vice presidential pick.",
        "Former Bush administration aide Nicolle Wallace interviewed Jeb Bush on Monday, talking to the former Florida governor about his own failed presidential campaign, his struggles to understand the Donald Trump phenomenon and his ongoing sad feelings about the 2016 race.

        "In her nearly six decades on shelves, perhaps no year has brought bigger change for Barbie than 2016. After watching the iconic doll\u2019s dominant market share slip every year since 2009, Mattel gambled in January on a major makeover. It gave Barbie more varied body shapes, skin tones and hair types. The overture was meant to address what has long been the hardest part of selling Barbie: Legions of parents think the buxom, doll sends a lousy message to girls about beauty standards. But, it turns out, her body was only part of the problem.",
        "A black Yale University dishwasher has resigned after he said he smashed a \u201cracist, very degrading\u201d window at the school that depicted slaves picking cotton. Corey Menafee, 38, told the New Haven Independent that he used a broomstick last month to break the windowpane in a residential dining hall, amid a nationwide debate over racist symbols on college campuses. \u201cIt\u2019s 2016; I shouldn\u2019t have to come to work and see things like that,\u201d Menafee told the newspaper, adding: \u201cI just said, \u2018That thing\u2019s coming down today.",
        "Dallas police respond after shots were fired at a Black Lives Matter rally in downtown Dallas. (Smiley N. Dallas Morning News) You\u2019ve probably seen the first photo above by now. It\u2019s of a woman calmly standing her ground as police officers heavily decked out in riot gear advance toward her to arrest her. The photo went viral, and many news outlets, including The Post, have written about it, some hailing it as the most iconic image from the events surrounding the aftermath of last week\u2019s awful spate of violence. Here at The Washington Post, Michael E.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 When Democrats gather for their national convention in Philadelphia, the list of speakers praising Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy is expected to feature the president, the vice president, the first lady, a former president and a galaxy of political luminaries. But when the Republican convention opens next week in Cleveland, presumptive nominee Donald Trump will showcase an assortment of family members, defeated primary opponents and politicians whose names barely register with the general public. Many of the GOP\u2019s past, current and future leaders are staying away from the spotlights at the Quicken Loans Arena.",
        "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Donald Trump stoked intense speculation about his narrowing search for a running mate Wednesday as he met privately with the apparent finalists here in Indianapolis, the culmination of a frequently televised talent contest now approaching its season finale. One by one, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee met with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) and Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.) summoning them for gatherings after weeks of teasing his uncertainty on social media and on the campaign trail.",
        "The architect of the CIA\u2019s brutal interrogation program was hired for the job through a secret contract in late 2001 that outlined the assignment with Orwellian euphemism. The agency \u201chas the need for someone familiar with conducting applied research in operational settings,\u201d the document said. The consultant would be in a unique position to \u201chelp guide and shape the future\u201d of a vaguely described research project \u201cin the area of and special operations. \u201d In fact, the CIA already had a specific consultant in mind, and the agreement to pay $1, 000 a day to psychologist James E.",
        "Behind the wheel of a BMW, the shot down River Road in Bethesda at 115 mph \u2014 70 over the posted limit. He was heading home after picking up Chinese food for his family. Ahead, on the other side of a slight rise, a Chevrolet Volt carrying a family of four was about to make a left turn from the opposing lanes. They were on their way to a high school play and were five minutes from curtain time. The crash was thunderous.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: With many political observers and commentators wringing their hands about the failure of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to unite the country in the wake of police killings in both directions, your humble blogger has tried to argue that this is the wrong line of inquiry. (Never mind whether the country is even as divided as some of these observers say.) Instead, for the reasons I\u2019ve tried to outline, we should be pointing out that one of the two candidates is actively trying to divide the country, while the other just isn\u2019t.",
        "Gordon Humphrey is a Kasich delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention. He represented New Hampshire in the Senate from 1979 to 1990. Some who oppose Donald Trump nevertheless note that he won the Republican primaries and, therefore, that next week will be his convention in Cleveland. Delegates should formalize his nomination and move on, they suggest. They are mistaken. It is not Trump\u2019s convention, not yet, anyway. Delegates are not rubber stamps; they are delegated authority to use their independent judgment.",
        "The editorial boards of both The Washington Post and the New York Times have rebuked Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her intemperate \u2014 but true \u2014 words about Donald Trump. In three separate interviews, she took Trump to task for being totally unfit for the presidency. The facts are with her, but she broke with a worthy tradition. Justice, as we all know, should be blind. Sometimes, it should be mute as well. This is one of those times."
