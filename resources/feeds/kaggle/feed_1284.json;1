        "People in commentariatville want to know what Megyn Kelly has to say about the sexual lawsuit filed by Gretchen Carlson against Fox News chief Roger Ailes. On his CNN program \u201cReliable Sources,\u201d media correspondent Brian Stelter remarked, \u201cWe\u2019ve not heard from Megyn Kelly, the host of Fox News. \u201d The Hollywood Reporter notes, \u201cMegyn Kelly, the most female anchor on the network, has yet to speak out about the controversy. \u201d Variety: \u201cMegyn Kelly, who has rocketed to fame on Fox News in the past few years, has yet to offer public remarks.",
        "President George W. Bush\u2019s appearance Tuesday at the Dallas memorial for the five police officers killed last week was in and of itself an important gesture. Just in showing up, Bush underscored that beyond politics, beyond partisanship, there is our shared humanity. He then delivered a concise but moving speech. Bush exhibited a trait rarely seen in politicians these days: humility. A man of deep religious beliefs prone to personal acts of kindness (according to friends and former aides) he steered clear of large sociological issues. He avoided trite political aphorisms. (President Obama unfortunately did not do the same.",
        "The U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has handed down a very important decision on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Facebook v. Vachani, which I flagged just last week. For those of us worried about broad readings of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the decision is quite troubling. Its reasoning appears to be very broad. If I\u2019m reading it correctly, it says that if you tell people not to visit your website, and they do it anyway knowing you disapprove, they\u2019re committing a federal crime of accessing your computer without authorization.",
        "South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott, the sole black Republican in the Senate, delivered a bristling and personal speech Wednesday in which he talked of being questioned by police simply because of his race. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep divide between the black community and law enforcement \u2014 a trust gap,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI do not know many African American men who do not have a very similar story to tell, no matter their profession, no matter their income, no matter their disposition in life.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s carefully choreographed political change of command culminated Wednesday with Theresa May inheriting the reins of a country caught in an unaccustomed vortex of uncertainty as it hurtles toward an exit from the European Union. May was invited to govern the country during an audience with Queen Elizabeth II only minutes after David Cameron visited Buckingham Palace and formally resigned as prime minister. A photo of May curtsying before a queen signaled the moment that May formally ascended to the country\u2019s highest political office.",
        "President Barack Obama and former president George W. Bush appeared together Tuesday at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas for an interfaith memorial service honoring the five officers who were slain Friday in the city\u2019s downtown. Both gave eloquent speeches before joining hands with their wives and many local officials in solidarity for the victims. During his speech, Bush said, \u201cToo often, we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions.",
        "Donald Trump is seeking damages from a fired campaign consultant, alleging that the staffer breached a confidentiality agreement he signed, a person close to Trump confirmed Wednesday. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is seeking funds through arbitration from Sam Nunberg, who was fired from the campaign last summer amid clashes with manager Corey Lewandowski and for posting what the campaign said was racially offensive material on Facebook. After parting ways with Trump, Nunberg endorsed Trump\u2019s rival, Sen. Ted Cruz. The Associated Press first reported the dispute on Wednesday afternoon.",
        "Even as GOP delegates endorsed a platform this week that tacks sharply to the right on gay rights, the Republican Party is about to nominate a presidential candidate who, in the past, has shown signs of sympathy and solidarity with the gay community. The disconnect has laid bare the deep fissure that persists within the Republican Party on LGBT issues more than a year after the Supreme Court ruled that marriages should be legal nationwide.",
        "The Portuguese slave ship had left Mozambique Island four weeks earlier and headed along the East African coast with its cargo of 500 captives, bound for the rice and cotton plantations of northern Brazil. Now, two days after Christmas, 1794, the Sao Jose Paquete d\u2019 Africa had been blown into treacherous waters near the Dutch settlement of Cape Town in southern Africa, and was impaled on the rocks. It was 2 a. m.",
        "There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty surrounding Russell Westbrook and his impending free agency following the season. Given Kevin Durant\u2019s decision to bolt from Oklahoma City to join the behemoth Golden State Warriors, Thunder General Manager Sam Presti can\u2019t necessarily afford to experience deja vu and lose Westbrook to another team in free agency and receive nothing in return. There\u2019s been a lot of chatter in Las Vegas around the NBA\u2019s summer league circuit, and according to Howard Beck of Bleacher Report, the chances of trading Westbrook \u2014 a perennial who averaged 23. 5 points, 10. 4 assists and 7.",

        "In a surprise move, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Luke Russert said Wednesday he is leaving the network in the middle of an election year \u2014 just before the Republican and Democratic conventions, no less \u2014 to pursue interests outside of journalism. The son of the late \u201dMeet the Press\u201d host Tim Russert tweeted a statement offering some insight into his thinking. \u201dIt\u2019s fair to say my broadcast career began in an unusual way after college graduation and the death of my father,\u201d he wrote.",
        "For the last decade, Americans in supermarket checkout lines have been inundated with the tabloid headlines: \u201cJen\u2019s finally PREGNANT!\u201d \u201cA Baby for Jen!\u201d \u201cJen: Pregnant and Alone. \u201d \u201cJen\u2019s Baby Dream Shattered. \u201d \u201cTWINS for Jen!\u201d Most people roll their eyes and move on \u2014 but after years of this nonsense, Jennifer Aniston had enough. The actress, the subject of countless magazine covers declaring her pregnancy despite the fact that she\u2019s never had a baby, wrote a powerful essay in the Huffington Post on Tuesday that declared, \u201cFor the record, I am not pregnant.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Indiana Gov. Mike Pence emerged Thursday as Donald Trump\u2019s likely running mate, with allies of Pence and Trump sending increasingly strong signals that Pence would join the GOP ticket and Republican leaders saying they have been told to stand by for an announcement. But less than 24 hours before Trump was set to reveal his choice at an event in New York, Trump had not made a formal offer, according Republicans familiar with the discussions who spoke Thursday on the condition of anonymity because the ongoing talks were confidential.",
        "This post has been updated Donald Trump is postponing his Friday plans to introduce his vice presidential running mate, he announced Thursday evening, citing the deadly attack in Nice, France as the reason for the delay. On Twitter and in television interviews on Fox News Channel, Trump said it would not be appropriate to follow through with plans to unveil his running mate on Friday morning. He also said he has not made a \u201dfinal, final\u201d decision who that person will be, even as public scrutiny was squarely on Indiana Gov. Mike Pence for much of the day.",
        "After weeks of intrigue, and a chaotic 24 hours, Donald Trump is choosing Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) as his vice presidential running mate.

        "When Haley Lind was found alone in a stranger\u2019s bathroom, she was naked and in a drunken stupor, barely able to stand or speak, a raucous party raging around her. She awoke in her bed hours later, her head pounding, leaves in her hair, soaked in her own urine. \u201cI think I got assaulted last night,\u201d she texted a friend the morning after the annual Block Party at the University of Virginia. \u201cSomething just feels very wrong.",
        "\u201cThe most significant reinforcement of our collective defense any time since the Cold War,\u201d President Obama called it. A bit of an exaggeration, perhaps, but it was still an achievement: Last week\u2019s NATO summit in Warsaw ordered the deployment of troops to Eastern Europe, the alliance\u2019s most serious response yet to Russia\u2019s aggression and provocations on its western frontier. The economic sanctions have been weak; the declamatory denunciations, a mere embarrassment. They\u2019ve only encouraged further reckless Russian behavior \u2014 the buzzing of U. S. ships, intrusions into European waters, threats to the Baltic States.",
        "Now that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has taken herself to the woodshed, it s worth asking what her brief bout of Trump Derangement Syndrome says about our system s ability to withstand four years of a Trump presidency. Short answer: It is not a good omen. As the idea of a President Trump has evolved from laughable to unlikely to a debate has raged in Washington.",
        "It has become conventional wisdom to note that President Obama has failed in his efforts to extricate the United States from military conflicts in the Middle East. Having promised to end these wars, he has in the past year expanded U. S. interventions in Iraq, Syria and other countries. The troop drawdown in Afghanistan has slowed to a trickle. \u201cObama\u2019s legacy,\u201d says Gene Healy of the Cato Institute, is clear: \u201cendless war. \u201d The New York Times\u2019 Mark Landler noted in May that Obama had just \u201cpassed a somber, milestone: He has now been at war longer than Mr.",
        "President Obama gave a majestic speech in Dallas, one of the best of his presidency, at once a soaring tribute to slain police officers and an affirmation of peaceful protest. But he was wrong about one thing: On race, sadly, we are as divided as we seem. This condition is not due to anything Obama has said or done. He bends so far backward to avoid giving offense, even to those who richly deserve offending, that he must need regular sessions with a chiropractor.",
        "PLANNING TO visit the 1. area in downtown Cleveland where many of the events and protests connected to the Republican National Convention will be held next week? Be sure not to take tennis balls, umbrellas or canned goods, which will be banned \u2014 but no need to leave behind your or other guns. Those will be allowed under Ohio\u2019s laws. That a can of tuna fish is deemed more dangerous than weaponry is indicative of the irrationality of U. S. gun policy. Don\u2019t expect a fix anytime soon.",
        "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Thursday that she should not have publicly criticized presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and that she would be more \u201ccircumspect\u201d in the future to avoid commenting on partisan politics. The senior member of the Supreme Court\u2019s liberal wing had criticized Trump in three separate media interviews since last week, calling him a \u201cfaker\u201d and saying she feared for the country and the Supreme Court if he were elected.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 Britain\u2019s new top diplomat, Boris Johnson, swept into office Thursday on a cloud of acrimony, amid worldwide disbelief that the irreverent campaigner for a British break from the European Union will now be his nation\u2019s main voice abroad. From composing a dirty limerick about the Turkish president and a goat to comparing the E. U. to Hitler and calling Hillary Clinton a \u201csadistic nurse,\u201d the Johnson spared few world leaders in his previous career as the mayor of London.",
        "MALAKAL, South Sudan \u2014 The dead were being counted in South Sudan\u2019s capital on Thursday, days after U. N. bases fell under fire and swaths of the city turned into an urban battlefield. The civil war, it appeared, had returned to the capital city of Juba. Even though the fighting that tore through the capital last weekend had mostly stopped by Tuesday, many of the 45, 000 people who fled the clashes searched for food and water, often without success. The United Nations had reached a critical shortage of basic aid supplies, officials said.",
        "It started with the seating. When the 33 invited participants to Wednesday\u2019s \u201cWhite House Convening on Building Community Trust\u201d filed into the conference room in the cavernous and ornate Eisenhower Executive Office Building, they discovered they would be placed next to improbable seatmates. Rashad Robinson, a black political activist, had Pittsburgh\u2019s police chief, Cameron McLay, on one side of him and Anaheim, Calif. Mayor Tom Tait on the other. Fraternal Order of Police Executive Director James O.",
        "Georgia executed an inmate early Friday morning, setting a modern record in the state while carrying out the country\u2019s first lethal injection in more than two months. Authorities say they executed John Wayne Conner, who was convicted of murder more than three decades ago, by lethal injection shortly before 12:30 a. m. early Friday, more than five hours after the execution was originally scheduled to occur. The Supreme Court had denied his requests for a stay in orders issued Thursday night, with the most recent order coming about 50 minutes before the execution occurred.",
        "Police in Fresno, Calif. on Wednesday released footage showing officers fatally shooting an unarmed Dylan Noble. The footage from June 25 shows officers pulling over Noble at a gas station in the central California city after police received a report of a man carrying a rifle. Noble was unarmed, but as he exited from his pickup truck, he repeatedly ignored officers\u2019 commands. The video shows him appear to hide his hands behind his back and walk toward officers, disobeying commands to show his hands, get on the ground and stop advancing.",
        "The attacks began to fly soon after Tarla Makaeff filed a 2010 fraud lawsuit against Trump University. First, Donald Trump filed a potentially ruinous defamation suit against the onetime customer of his seminar business. That case was tossed out by a judge, but it launched a recurring counteroffensive by Trump that put Makaeff \u201cthrough the wringer,\u201d according to her lawyers in a court filing, and has coincided with his presidential candidacy.",
        "In theory, Sen. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia is Hillary Clinton\u2019s ideal wingman. A former governor from a crucial swing state, Kaine would be a genial antidote for a Democratic presidential nominee tarred by decades of controversy. Even Republicans struggle for ways to attack Kaine, a Harvard Law School graduate who is fluent in Spanish and who volunteered as a missionary in Honduras. As he emerges as Clinton\u2019s potential running mate, Kaine\u2019s tenure in public office \u2014 lauded by Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 is evidence that nice guys can finish first in American politics."
