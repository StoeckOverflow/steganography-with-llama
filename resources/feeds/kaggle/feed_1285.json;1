        "Donald Trump\u2019s younger daughter Tiffany will command a national audience in her speaking slot at the Republican National Convention next week, where we will all but certainly see her father selected as the party\u2019s presidential nominee. Sure, it\u2019s a kind of political debut for the often thought of as the least known of the older Trump kids. She\u2019s certainly less prominent on Team Trump than her glamorous, poised Ivanka Trump and half brothers Donald Jr. and Eric, all of whom are executives with the Trump Organization, their dad\u2019s company.",
        "Just 16 feet from history on Thursday, Phil Mickelson\u2019s final putt found everything but the record book. Mickelson\u2019s birdie putt at Royal Troon\u2019s No. 18 skirted around the hole and out, leaving him just shy of becoming the first male golfer in history to shoot a 62 at a event. His 63 was plenty good enough for the lead at the British Open, however, and he became the 28th male golfer to card that score at one of the four Grand Slam events. Phil Mickelson came SO close to a low major score of 62 #TheOpen pic. twitter.",

        "It\u2019s been awhile since Bill Simmons took a shot at ESPN. Better check his Twitter to see if something\u2019s wrong. Ahhh, there it is. USDA Choice Hate. Anyway, these types of barrages have gotten Simmons in trouble before, like when he called NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell a liar and ESPN suspended him for two weeks in 2014.",
        "\u201c \u2018The Ballad of Sexual Dependency\u2019 is the diary I let people read,\u201d Nan Goldin wrote. \u201cThe diary is my form of control over my life. It allows me to obsessively record every detail. It enables me to remember. \u201d Goldin\u2019s \u201cBallad\u201d documented her \u201ctribe. \u201d This intimate photographic journal, that debuted at the Whitney Biennial in New York in 1985, is on display at the MoMA in New York with nearly 700 photographs sequenced to a music soundtrack.

        "Three years ago today, the #BlackLivesMatter movement was born. It was born after Trayvon Martin. It grew after Michael Brown and Eric Garner. It sprung from decades of injustice and disregard. And as it grew, it planted seeds in artists\u2019 minds. And from these seeds grew images of anger, solace, fear, hope, empowerment. Some artists reap signs of peace and serenity, but many find the need to dig deep. For some, it is a call to harvest images of rage.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey\u2019s military launched a coup Friday against the elected government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish officials and the armed forces said, in a stunning move that will likely plunge the U. S. ally into further turmoil and reverberate across an already bloodstained and chaotic region. The military declared martial law and announced a curfew late Friday night, citing the government\u2019s \u201dautocratic rule\u201d and a deterioration in security, the armed forces said in statements carried by Turkey\u2019s state broadcaster.",
        "Amid an attempted military coup in Turkey, one key player\u2019s whereabouts are still murky: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The president addressed the nation using FaceTime, describing the events as \u201dan attempt at an uprising by a minority within our armed forces\u201d and called on supporters to take to the streets. Erdogan had spoken from \u201da secure location,\u201d a senior government official has said. That secure location remains a mystery. The press office for the Turkish Embassy in Washington has since tweeted a series of statements, attributed to Erdogan.",
        "The U. S. military on Saturday was working with officials in Turkey to get a key air base operational in the fight against the Islamic State. Security was boosted to its highest level at bases across Turkey during Friday\u2019s coup attempt against the Turkish government, a measure typically reserved for when there is an ongoing terrorist attack. A U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, said Saturday that force protection was elevated Friday night to level Delta. That typically signifies a terrorist attack has occurred or that one is considered imminent nearby.",
        "NICE, France \u2014 A \u00e9migr\u00e9 with a record of petty crime was behind the wheel of a truck that barreled into Bastille Day revelers and claimed at least 84 lives over a path of horror, a French prosecutor said Friday, as investigators explored possible links to Islamist militant networks. The driver was identified as Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, whose identity documents, cellphone and bank card were found inside the truck used in Thursday\u2019s carnage along a French Riviera corniche in Nice, according to Paris Prosecutor Fran\u00e7ois Molins.",
        "The use of a truck to cut down scores of seaside revelers in Nice, France \u2014 if connected to terrorism \u2014 would represent a dramatic escalation in what experts describe as an emerging trend in attacks: simple, even crude instruments employed to kill numbers of people. Thursday\u2019s rampage appears to have set a grisly new standard as one of the deadliest attacks in years in which most victims were killed by nonexplosive means. Instead of guns or bombs, the driver mainly used his vehicle to crush men, women and children who had gathered to watch a fireworks display.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump announced Friday that he has selected Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, ending days of feverish speculation and recruiting to the GOP ticket a and seasoned conservative who could help unify the divided Republican Party. \u201cI am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate,\u201d Trump wrote in a Twitter message delivered at 10:50 a. m. Saturday\u2019s planned 11 a. m. news conference will be held in New York at the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan.",
        "Mike Pence was a young lawyer on the rise, challenging a longtime Democratic congressman in a Indiana district. And then, scandal. Campaign finance records from the 1990 effort showed that Pence, then 31, had been using political donations to pay the mortgage on his house, his personal credit card bill, groceries, golf tournament fees and car payments for his wife. The spending had not been illegal at the time. But it stunned voters \u2014 and undermined Pence\u2019s strategy to portray the incumbent, Rep. Philip R. Sharp, as tainted by donations from political action committees.",
        "Just as the Indianapolis Star reported on Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump has selected Gov. Mike Pence ( .) as his running mate. But between the Star\u2019s report and Trump\u2019s confirmation of it, Trump managed to do just about everything possible to draw attention away from the assets that Pence provides to his campaign and, instead, to make his campaign look like a mess. It is always the case that the pick is made at the discretion of the person at the top of the ticket.",
        "Somebody close to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is apparently leaking something very unhelpful. Scoop: @realDonaldTrump was so unsure about @mike_pence that around midnight last night he asked top aides if he could get out of it \u2014 Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) July 15, 2016 Sources tell me @realDonaldTrump was on phone till midnight making calls, asking if he could change course on VP pick \u2014 Kelly O\u2019Donnell (@KellyO) July 15, 2016 Trump spokesman Jason Miller is forcefully denying it: This is completely false. Zero truth to it. https: .",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate is just what everyone is saying it is: a safe, traditional choice. Pence won\u2019t hurt him too much and may help him with Republican politicians and some conservatives. But it is also \u2014 and more importantly \u2014 something else: a sign of real weakness. There were many Republicans who could have helped Trump far more. He could not turn to them because they are scrambling as far away from this ticket as they can.",
        "AS A conservative crusader, Mike Pence is an incongruous match for the ideologically flexible Donald Trump, who employed Twitter to name the Republican Indiana governor as his running mate Friday. Then again, anyone with a halfway respectable record in public office would have been an odd partner. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate to Mr. Pence\u2019s time in show business: The governor was a radio host in the 1990s before winning election to the House in 2000. Though Mr. Pence is reportedly more easygoing than Mr. Trump, he has a bit of Mr.",
        "Jeb Bush was governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007 and a 2016 Republican candidate for president. Call it a tipping point, a time of choosing or testing. Whatever you call it, it is clear that this election will have consequences for both the Republican Party and our exceptional country. While he has no doubt tapped into the anxiety so prevalent in the United States today, I do not believe Donald Trump reflects the principles or inclusive legacy of the Republican Party. And I sincerely hope he doesn\u2019t represent its future.",
        "It was just another week in Donald Trump\u2019s (white) America First campaign. At least twice, Trump alleged that people have called for a \u201cmoment of silence\u201d for the madman who killed five police officers in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter protest. It was an incendiary accusation, bound to stir racial hatred. Like Trump\u2019s accusation that New Jersey Muslims cheered the attacks, this, too, was categorically false. There was no sign of such calls, and a top Trump adviser couldn\u2019t corroborate the allegation.",
        "Danielle Allen has suggested that Americans return to our roots as logicians by embracing the syllogism (an argument with two premises that lead logically to a conclusion) to describe the 2016 election. She suggested the example: It is necessary that a president understand the art of democracy. But Trump does not understand the art of democracy. Therefore it is necessary that Trump should not be a president. You can even express these conditions with a Venn Diagram, if you like. And I do like. Here are a few syllogisms and Venn Diagrams to sum up the election so far.",
        "A document, detailing suspected connections between Saudi Arabia and the hijackers who carried out the Sept. 2001 attacks, was released Friday by the House Intelligence Committee after being redacted by U. S. intelligence. The document, referred to as the \u201c \u201d throughout a battle over whether it should be made public, was part of a 2002 joint inquiry by the Senate and House Intelligence Committees into the attacks.",
        "Wayne Simmons was a professional football player, a drug trafficker, a nightclub doorman, a Fox News guest analyst and an intelligence adviser in Afghanistan. What Simmons, 62, was not, according to all available evidence, was a CIA agent. In federal court in Virginia on Friday, just before he was sentenced to 33 months in prison, he apologized for lying about his security clearance, his criminal history and his finances. \u201cThere is not a day that goes by that I am not haunted by these mistakes,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI stand before you a shameful and broken man.",
        "Deflategate, at long last, is over. New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady on Friday announced on Facebook that he \u201cwill no longer proceed with the legal process\u201d after a federal court shot down his latest attempt at an appeal earlier this week. Brady\u2019s only remaining recourse was the U. S. Supreme Court, which legal observers viewed as a long shot, at best.",
        "After the blue and red police lights flashed behind his car, Louizandre Dauphin figured he may have added another \u201cprohibited\u201d item to the list of things you can\u2019t do while black: Reading. Dauphin, 33, a former high school English teacher, had decided to relax last week with a few books at Stonehaven Wharf, a parking lot for fishing boats that\u2019s frequented by tourists to the Canadian province of New Brunswick. He sat inside his Volkswagen Golf hatchback watching the waves and poring over \u201cMere Christianity\u201d by C. S. Lewis and another book by theologian Timothy Keller.",
        "I had been dating my boyfriend, Jason, for only a couple of months when he suggested we move across the country to Albuquerque, where we knew no one, so I could write a novel while he worked to support us. \u201cThat\u2019s the most romantic thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me,\u201d I told him. I was 22, and he was 19. Jason loved me. His charisma was like a bright, shining light, and I felt lucky to feel its warmth.",
        "MONDAY My first attempt at Pok\u00e9mon Go has brought me to my favorite used bookstore, owned by an endearingly irascible man whose handwritten house rules include: No cell phones. I\u2019ve bought a mile of books from this store, including volumes of Shakespeare and Livy, the plays of Lillian Hellman and poems of Wilfred Owen and an incredibly ratty paperback version of \u201cThe Guns of August,\u201d which was scandalously overpriced but I was in a panic to finish an assignment and am too cheap to join Amazon Prime.",
        "When Synody Mulibehzi woke up June 27, 2012, he had two good arms. By nightfall, he would have just one. Back then, Mulibehzi and his brother were employed on an team on a conservancy in Zambia, according to accounts made to photographer Benjamin Rutherford. Such teams are employed on game reserves, conservancies and farms, to protect animals from being poached and sold as bushmeat. On that day, Mulibehzi and seven others responded to a report of an early morning gunshot on the conservancy that he regularly patrolled.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 The Turkish government on Saturday quelled most of the last threats from an attempted military coup, but it was a greatly diminished Turkey that emerged from the chaos of the night before. As dazed citizens stumbled through streets littered with the remains of tanks and armored vehicles used by the renegade troops, authorities embarked on a sweeping roundup of thousands of people suspected of involvement in what appears to have been a effort to replace Turkey\u2019s democratically elected government with a military junta.",
        "In the age of the smartphone, the coup attempt in Turkey perhaps didn\u2019t stand a chance. As speculation swirled on social media on Friday night, a group of mutinous troops took over the TRT station \u2014 not a particularly popular network \u2014 and forced an anchor to read on air a statement drafted by them about the apparent power grab. Other military units had massed at major bridges and public buildings in Istanbul, Turkey\u2019s biggest city, and Ankara, the nation\u2019s capital.",
        "The man that Turkey\u2019s leaders have blamed for a failed coup attempt by a group of army officers is an Islamic scholar named Fethullah Gulen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania and who has inspired a network said to include more than 160 charter schools in the United States. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says that the coup attempt Friday was the work of army officers who are followers of Gulen, who had once been an ally but whose movement has become critical of the increasingly authoritarian regime."
