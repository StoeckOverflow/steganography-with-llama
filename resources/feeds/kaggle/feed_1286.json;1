        "ISTANBUL \u2014 On the night of the failed military coup, Istanbul\u2019s towering bridges hosted hellish scenes of chaos and bloodshed, as ordinary Turks \u2014 in stunning acts of bravery and defiance \u2014 poured into the streets to halt a violent army takeover of the country\u2019s civilian government. But by dawn, the soldiers who had seized key roads and infrastructure just hours before, could be seen surrendering to police on those same bridges, their hands in the air as they stood in the light.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 As the gavel drops to begin the Republican National Convention here on Monday, the party will be focused on two goals: reintroducing Donald Trump as someone the country could imagine in the Oval Office during dangerous times, and healing the leftover wounds of a brutal primary season. \u201cThe convention\u2019s coming at a good time for us to turn the page,\u201d a hopeful Reince Priebus, the party\u2019s chairman, said in an interview after spending the week snuffing out a \u201cNever Trump\u201d revolt among a rebellious group of party rulemakers.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Introducing his new running mate on Saturday, Donald Trump stood alone behind a lectern bearing only his name and rambled for 28 minutes about his primary victories, what he called Hillary Clinton\u2019s crimes against the country, how pastors should be allowed to endorse candidates and how he correctly predicted the outcome of the Brexit vote. Occasionally, Trump mentioned his new \u201cpartner,\u201d Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, mostly looking down to read from notes when he did.",
        "Donald Trump has already had problems making inroads with female, gay and minority voters. His pick, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, could make things even worse. Pence, the Republican governor of Indiana, has endorsed conservative legislation on abortion, gay rights and immigration both in his home state and while in Congress, where he was consistently ranked as one of the most members of the House. He attempted to shut down the government over Planned Parenthood funding, supported a measure that made English the nation\u2019s official language and signed one of the nation\u2019s strictest abortion laws earlier this year.",
        "Donald Trump is many things, but most of all he is a doer. He builds buildings, he starts businesses, he does deals. As he put it in his 1990 book, \u201cSurviving at the Top,\u201d \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned about the construction business \u2014 and life in general \u2014 is that while what you do is obviously important, the most important thing is just to do something. \u201d This may sound like good business advice, and it may even be good life advice, but it is precisely the wrong attitude for a president of the United States.",
        "When Philando Castile, a black man legally carrying a concealed weapon, was shot dead by police during a traffic stop in Minnesota this month for no apparent reason other than that he was armed, it seemed like an obvious case for the National Rifle Association to rally behind. The Second Amendment protects everyone\u2019s right to bear arms, not just white people\u2019s, right? By the light of the law, the answer is easy: The Constitution prohibits racial discrimination in all rights, including the right to bear arms. By the light of history, however, the answer is far more complicated.",

        "My parents were the kind of polite conservatives who would have been appalled by this year\u2019s Republican presidential campaign. They belonged to that stuffy but understated class of Eastern WASPs who were gently mocked by the late satirist William Hamilton in the New Yorker. His cartoons depicted a world of Wodehousian clubbiness, cocktail parties and golden retrievers in station wagons. One of my favorite scenes, found in his collection \u201c Register,\u201d shows a woman at a party, looking horrified at something a man is explaining. \u201cI simply can\u2019t believe that nice communities release effluents,\u201d she protests.",
        "As the Republican convention kicks off next week, longtime observers of the wing of the GOP are in for a long bout of cognitive dissonance. Heading up the party of the right will be the boorish, lewd and avatar of \u201cNew York values,\u201d Donald Trump.",
        "RECEP TAYYIP Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s arrogant and increasingly autocratic president, survived a coup attempt Friday after the nation\u2019s beleaguered democratic institutions rallied behind him. Opposition political parties that Mr. Erdogan has persecuted quickly issued statements condemning the coup. When soldiers occupied state television, private news media that the president has intimidated and censored provided him with the means to speak to the country. Social media that Mr. Erdogan has been prone to shut down broadcast video of street rallies across the country. Having been backed by Turkey\u2019s democrats after a faction of the nationalist military turned on him, Mr.",
        "NICE, France \u2014 The man who plowed a truck down a crowded Nice thoroughfare and killed 84 people was a \u201csoldier of the Islamic State,\u201d the militant group said Saturday, as French authorities said the attacker was inspired by terrorist organizations. It remained unclear whether the Islamic State had directed the attack, was taking responsibility for an assault it inspired or was simply seeking publicity from an event in which it had no direct hand.",
        "NICE, France \u2014 Red roses were gently placed over blood stains on the asphalt, as were notes of solidarity and, in some cases, gratitude for a life saved. On the sidewalk, couples cried and held each other. A woman wore a that read: \u201cNice is not the same. \u201d On Saturday, French authorities partially reopened the storied Promenade des Anglais, the seaside boulevard on which a resident of France barreled a truck into crowds gathered for a Bastille Day fireworks display, killing 84 and wounding more than 200, including children.",
        "The attack in Nice, France, that killed at least 84 people and injured hundreds of others was brutally simple and very difficult to prevent. A truck, barreling into a crowd of Bastille Day revelers, mowed down bystanders celebrating Bastille Day before the driver opened fire. In the United States, it is fair to see the carnage in France and ask if something similar could unfold here. \u201cThat answer is undoubtedly yes,\u201d said Gregory Shaffer, a former FBI agent who has worked extensively on national security issues and served on the bureau\u2019s Hostage Rescue Team.",
        "President Obama never liked the phrase \u201cwar on terror,\u201d declared by his predecessor, George W. Bush, barely a week after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bush sometimes also likened the ensuing conflict to World War III. Obama has a very different way with words. Although he, too, has spoken of \u201cwar\u201d on occasion, he leans more toward the \u201cseries of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America\u201d that he outlined in a 2013 speech. But whatever the preferred rhetoric, and despite the constant U. S.",
        "ISLAMABAD \u2014 Pakistani fashion model Qandeel Baloch, who recently stirred controversy by posting pictures of herself with a Muslim cleric on social media, was strangled to death by her brother, police said Saturday. Her parents told police one of her six brothers strangled her to death as she slept in the family\u2019s home in Multan, police spokeswoman Nabila Ghazanfar told The Associated Press. She said police are searching for the suspect. Baloch, whose real name was Fauzia Azeem, was little known until recently, when she offended many conservatives by posting pictures of herself with Mufti Qavi, a prominent cleric.",
        "Summer classes started this week, somehow, at El Centro College, where the main campus is sealed off as a crime scene, the school s computer servers were destroyed by a police robot bomb, and two campus police officers are recovering from injuries they received while battling a gunman intent on killing police.",
        "When police showed up at a vacant in Penn Township, Pa. last month, neighbor Pat Beck was worried something might be wrong. Their presence seemed even more mysterious when Beck saw an investigator remove a box from the home and place it in a police vehicle. Several weeks later, a reporter from Fox affiliate WPMT finally told Beck what was inside that box: a human brain. \u201cIt just scares me to death,\u201d a terrified Beck told the station. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they were that kind of people, but nowadays, you never know.",
        "ST. LOUIS \u2014 Hillary Clinton will call for a constitutional amendment to \u201doverturn Citizens United\u201d in her first 30 days as president and plans to make that announcement today to progressive activists at the annual Netroots Nation conference. \u201dI will also appoint Supreme Court justices who understand that this decision was a disaster for our democracy,\u201d Clinton will say in a video message, scheduled to run near the end of today\u2019s final keynote session. \u201dI will fight for other progressive reforms, including matching and disclosure requirements.",
        "Republican Donald Trump\u2019s and Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s efforts to portray themselves as assertive adversaries of the Islamic State terror group are increasingly defining the 2016 presidential race \u2014 and never more so than in the wake of the massacre in Nice, France, this week. Although authorities have not yet tied the attack to terrorism, both candidates immediately responded to the latest in a string of attacks at home and abroad that have heightened voter anxiety by vowing aggressive efforts to combat the Islamic State.",
        "This is a primer on how to eat bread. Maybe that sounds like an inane exercise because you\u2019ve been eating copious amounts of it all your life. Or maybe you have recently sworn it off completely, avoiding the restaurant bread basket like a great peril. But these common extremes are testament to why we need to rethink our approach to this ancient staple and learn how to get the most out of it, for both sensory pleasure and nutrition. Despite all the clamoring, bread can be very healthy, particularly if it is made with whole grains.",
        "Two weeks ago I was nostalgically cradling pots and pans on my kitchen floor. I didn\u2019t want to give them up \u2014 they never quit on me, not during any of the dinner parties I hosted in my apartment. But the dinner parties were becoming more rare. I had the option to sacrifice my kitchen stuff \u2014 plus a dozen books, two lamps and a sofa \u2014 for a more exciting social life, and I decided to exercise it. I gave up my bright, airy, apartment in D.",
        "We have just emerged, bloodied but not beaten, from our daughter\u2019s junior year of high school. In addition to a plethora of challenging classes, there were state standardized tests (appropriately referred to as the SOLs [Standards of Learning exams]) to be passed for verified credits. There were Advanced Placement tests to survive. There were ACTs and SATs (old and new versions for the latter, plus subject exams).",
        "Three police officers were killed and three others injured in a shooting Sunday morning in Baton Rouge, authorities said. While police offered few immediate details about the exact origins of the incident, they say the violent incident unfolded early Sunday when officers responded to reports of a man carrying a rifle in an area filled with grocery stores and other businesses. Col. Michael D.",
        "Joycelyn Jackson was already sitting in church when she found herself needing God most. She hadn\u2019t yet learned that her little brother Montrell Jackson was among the three officer killed in Baton Rouge when her pastor asked the congregation to send prayers to her family. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to break down in church but it was just something I couldn\u2019t hold,\u201d Jackson, 49, of Lake Charles, Louisiana, said. \u201cHe was a wonderful person. A wonderful person.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 The arrests of thousands of military officers, soldiers and other suspects linked to a failed coup in Turkey have opened a punishing campaign by the authorities against alleged plotters amid signs of chaos in the armed forces. Turkey\u2019s justice minister confirmed that as many as 6, 000 people \u2014 including generals and a commander of an air base used by U. S. warplanes to target Islamic State militants \u2014 had been detained by early Sunday.",
        "LUXEMBOURG \u2014 Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Sunday that the failed coup in Turkey has created only minor delays in the military campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and that it will not diminish Turkey\u2019s role in the fight. Kerry, who talked by phone three separate times Saturday with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, told CNN he was assured that the continuing turmoil will not interrupt counterterrorism efforts based in Turkey. Missions against the Islamic State are flown out of Incirlik Air Base, near the southern Turkish city of Adana.",
        "NICE, FRANCE \u2014 With this coastal city reeling from the Bastille Day attack by one of its residents, one sentiment is growing stronger and stronger: Keep the immigrants out. Across France, it is voiced by the National Front party, which counts Nice as a stronghold. It is embraced by the politicians dogging French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande ahead of elections next year. And though Hollande has preached tolerance and unity every time terrorism strikes France, his allies are also trying to tamp down immigration.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 As he has prepared to be named the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump has not read any biographies of presidents. He said he would like to someday. He has no time to read, he said: \u201cI never have. I\u2019m always busy doing a lot. Now I\u2019m more busy, I guess, than ever before. \u201d Trump\u2019s desk is piled high with magazines, nearly all of them with himself on their covers, and each morning, he reviews a pile of printouts of news articles about himself that his secretary delivers to his desk.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump and Mike Pence, having bungled the formal unveiling of their partnership as the 2016 GOP presidential ticket, attempted a day later on Sunday to disprove the adage that you never get a second chance to make a first impression.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 The deadly shootings of police officers in Baton Rouge on Sunday, coming after the coup attempt and subsequent roundup of plotters in Turkey over the weekend, which followed a devastating attack in the French city of Nice, all have combined to redraw the backdrop for the Republican National Convention, which opens here Monday. In normal times, American political conventions command the attention of the world. They are carefully designed infomercials for the two main U. S. political parties and their presidential nominees."
