        "CLEVELAND \u2014 On the eve of the two national political conventions that will shape the images of the presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a competitive contest nationally but with the presumptive Republican nominee facing deficits on key character attributes and issues, according to a new Washington News poll. The survey shows Clinton leading Trump by 47 percent to 43 percent among registered voters. That represents a shift in Trump\u2019s direction since last month\u2019s poll, which showed Clinton leading by 12 points.",
        "CINCINNATI \u2014 A liberal firebrand who could stoke the passions of the Democratic base. A Hispanic who could fire up one of the country\u2019s population \u2014 and make history. Someone with governing experience who might also help with a key group where Demo crats lag: white men. With less than a week to go before presumed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is expected to select a running mate, these are among her choices. She has focused intensely on the task in recent days, according to multiple interviews with Democrats familiar with her thinking.",
        "When a law student several years ago asked Justice Antonin Scalia about the path that would someday lead to a federal judgeship or perhaps even the Supreme Court, the answer sounded surprising. Get involved in politics, he said. The thing that separates all the smart lawyers who would like to become federal judges from the ones who actually become judges is most often political connections. [Did Ginsburg cross line with comments about Trump?] The Notorious RBG and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump traded insults. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of what the two have said.",
        "A college student was found in the roadside bushes of a small northern Indian city last week, raped and left for dead. In the days afterward, a shocking possibility came to light: Her attackers may be the same five men who had raped her three years earlier but were out on bail. They allegedly raped her again because she had been so steadfast in her case against them. Heinous rape cases periodically find airtime in the Indian news cycle, but the outcry is often muted when the victim belongs to a lower caste.",

        "After months of debate over the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill, and at an apparent impasse over privatizing air traffic control, Congress has settled on a compromise \u2014 with some unexpected benefits for the average air traveler. The House and Senate have agreed on an extension that would fund the agency at current levels through September 2017. Among other things, it would also require airlines to seat families with children together without charging them more, accelerate the security screening process and issue prompt refunds for baggage fees when luggage is lost for more than 12 hours.",
        "Trying to cut back on sugar? Dessert is probably the toughest place to do that, but with a little creativity you can do it. Here are a few things to keep in mind. Eat more fruit. The sugars it contains are natural, and, like most things, can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet. Roast, grill or slices of fruit, which will concentrate their sweetness. Pineapple, mango, peaches and watermelon (see below) work particularly well. Go for the ripest, local fruit. The riper it is, the sweeter it tastes, and that\u2019s good for portion control.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Republican attempts to slow Donald Trump\u2019s march to the presidential nomination failed on Monday afternoon \u2014 but not before chaos erupted on the Republican National Convention floor as a nationwide audience watched. A renegade group of delegates seeking to force a rules vote that would have embarrassed Trump and top GOP officials fell short of securing enough signatures to compel one. The reason: a handful of delegations withdrew support for the measure, bowing to the wishes of Trump and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.",
        "For weeks, rumors that rump Republicans dissatisfied with the idea of Donald Trump as the party\u2019s presidential nominee would stage a protest vote swirled. On Monday, those disgruntled Republicans made good on their pledge \u2014 sort of. The fight happened just after 4 p. m. eastern \u2014 three hours after the convention was gaveled in on its first day. At issue was the approval of the rules package that sets the parameters for the convention. forces tried to push through the package on a voice vote. Then this happened: ROLL CALL VOTE! !!! pic. twitter.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Paul Ryan is from Venus. Donald Trump is from Mars. As Republicans gathered here on Monday, it sounded as though the elected official in their party and the man it is about to nominate for president were planning two different conventions. The one that Trump\u2019s campaign described will be a display of bare knuckles and big messages, with little by way of concrete substance. \u201cThe American people are not looking for a plan right now.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 The lobby of the Westin hotel here is a palace for insiders: the headquarters for Donald Trump and the Republicans managing his bid for the White House. Inside this guarded refuge, an accidental political revival is under way. A coterie of operatives who reached the peak of their profession when they steered Robert J. Dole to the 1996 nomination, only to be sidelined by a newer generation, has returned to power with Trump\u2019s takeover of the Republican Party.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 By the time Jeff Sessions appeared before the Senate to answer questions about his nomination to the federal bench, his reputation was in tatters. Former colleagues had accused him of frequently making racist comments, such as accusing the NAACP of teaching \u201c values\u201d and agreeing with a comment that a white civil rights lawyer litigating voting rights cases was a \u201cdisgrace to his race. \u201d With his nomination all but doomed, Sessions pleaded for a chance to salvage his reputation. \u201cI am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create,\u201d said Sessions, then a U.",
        "Authorities said Monday that they believe the gunman who opened fire in Baton Rouge a day earlier, killing three police officers and injuring three others before he was fatally shot by a SWAT team, was specifically after law enforcement officers in the city. \u201cThere is no doubt whatsoever that these officers were intentionally targeted and assassinated,\u201d Col. Michael Edmonson, superintendent of the Louisiana State Police, said at a news conference. \u201cIt was a calculated act.",
        "The day after five police officers were fatally shot during a protest in Dallas, Gavin Long took to YouTube to express a controversial view on the incident. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna harp on that, you know, with a brother killing the police. You get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Long said, according to a video posted online. \u201cThat\u2019s, it\u2019s justice.",
        "On the day Alton Sterling died at the hands of two Baton Rouge officers, a veteran of the police force made a vow that he shared on Facebook. \u201cI swear as God is my witness I will do everything in my power to steer my son along a different career path from what I chose for myself. He can do better. \u201d Those words were written by Montrell Jackson on July 5, 12 days before the new father became one of three law enforcement officers killed Sunday in Baton Rouge.",

        "The Trump campaign worked behind the scenes last week to make sure the new Republican platform won\u2019t call for giving weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forces, contradicting the view of almost all Republican foreign policy leaders in Washington. Throughout the campaign, Trump has been dismissive of calls for supporting the Ukraine government as it fights an ongoing intervention. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, worked as a lobbyist for the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych for more than a decade.",
        "As we head to Cleveland today, we certainly have been reminded that the GOP electorate picked someone as its nominee who is not only unfit to govern but entirely incapable of running a national campaign.",
        "The Republican Party came to life as the bastion of \u201cFree Soil, Free Labor, Free Speech, Free Men. \u201d It was a reformist party dedicated to stopping the spread of slavery and to fighting a \u201cSlave Power\u201d its founders saw as undermining free institutions. The new political organization grew out of the old Whigs and reflected the faith that Henry Clay and his admirer Abraham Lincoln had in the federal government\u2019s ability to invest in fostering economic growth and expanding educational opportunity. Its partisans embodied what John C. Calhoun, slavery\u2019s chief ideological defender, described disdainfully as \u201cthe national impulse.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 The marriage of Donald Trump and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is not off to a great start. Donald Trump introduced Pence as his running mate as if it were a painful duty, in a series of long digressions about himself that he had to keep dragging back on track, perhaps hoping that if he talked about himself long enough the situation might resolve itself.",
        "AT THE Winter Olympics in Sochi in early 2014, no Russian athletes tested positive for doping, and they took home 33 medals, more than any other nation. But the reality was far different. A secret system was in place that concealed the use of drugs by the Russians. Moreover, doping and coverups have been carried out by Russia across a range of international competitions from late 2011 to 2015, according to the report made public Monday by the World Agency and led by Canadian law professor Richard H. McLaren.",

        "If it weren\u2019t for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton would be the most disliked presidential nominee in recent American history. That qualifier, of course, is important here. Clinton doesn\u2019t need to be liked; she needs to be liked slightly more than Trump in what will very likely boil down to a race. But it\u2019s hard to overstate just how bad Clinton\u2019s numbers are. And a new Washington News poll is the latest to suggest they just keep getting worse \u2014 so much so that they are in some ways about as bad as Trump\u2019s.",

Saturday afternoon when they set off to find a friend, according to authorities. Whether it was the booze or the sheer similarity of the neighborhood\u2019s homes, the teens somehow ended up at the wrong house. One of the teenagers, a boy, banged on the door.

        "Roger Ailes could soon be out as chief executive of Fox News, according to New York magazine. That would be a monumental development at any time. In two decades of leadership, Ailes built the cable news channel into the popular and polarizing media behemoth it is today. The former Republican operative created a forum for conservative perspective, in addition to straight news, that resonated with viewers who see a liberal slant in the rest of the mainstream media. In many ways, Ailes is Fox News."
