        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump was formally nominated for the presidency by Republican delegates here on Tuesday night, a landmark moment in American political history that capped the business mogul\u2019s surprising conquest of the GOP. Trump reached the threshold of 1, 237 delegates at 7:12 p. m. with votes cast by delegates from his home state of New York.

        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Settling for the last candidate standing was not the way that Jessica Fernandez, the president of Miami\u2019s Young Republicans, originally envisioned her first national political convention. Fernandez had hoped for a joyous multicultural and multigenerational experience cheering Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) a fellow Cuban American from her old neighborhood. But by the time the Republican National Convention got underway this week, Fernandez was dealing with a reality.",
        "In the wake of the media maelstrom over Melania Trump\u2019s lifting of several passages from a speech Michelle Obama gave in 2008, I reached out to Michael Gerson, the chief speechwriter for George W. Bush. My goal in talking to Gerson, who is now a syndicated columnist with the Washington Post, was to get a better understanding of how something like this could happen, who should be blamed and what it said about the broader Trump campaign. Our conversation, conducted via email and edited only for grammar, is below. FIX: Explain how the vetting process for a George W.",
        "This story has been updated. Like so many politicians who\u2019ve leapt overnight into national scrutiny, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence now faces intense journalistic vetting \u2014 which tends to include an onslaught of cringeworthy throwbacks. One day after Donald Trump named Pence his pick for vice president, reporters unearthed a 1999 essay he penned characterizing Disney\u2019s \u201cMulan\u201d as liberal propaganda. \u201cDespite her delicate features and voice, Disney expects us to believe that Mulan\u2019s ingenuity and courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal basis with her cloddish cohorts,\u201d Pence wrote in the .",
        "CLEVELAND  \u201d Donald Trump s advisers say his greatest imperative at the Republican National Convention is to showcase the candidate as a crisp manager and a decisive leader. By that measure, he has gotten off to a bad start. The flap over the apparent plagiarism in his wife s   speech has underscored the dissonance between the person Trump claims to be and what his actions and reactions say about the qualities he would bring to the Oval Office.

        "CLEVELAND \u2014 When the opening night of the Republican National Convention ended here, Donald Trump\u2019s advisers were exuberant \u2014 thrilled with Melania Trump\u2019s sparkling debut and confident that Rudy Giuliani and a parade of other speakers delivered the ideal combination of fire, emotion and reassurance. One hour later, they were in crisis mode. The potential first lady\u2019s address \u2014 the night\u2019s highlight \u2014 was suddenly under attack because of apparent plagiarism. By morning, the campaign\u2019s efforts at damage control added up to a series of conflicting explanations and recriminations.",
        "HOLMES COUNTY, Ohio \u2014 In this deeply conservative part of Ohio, full of cornfields and Amish buggies, people know all about Donald Trump\u2019s two very public divorces, his extramarital affair with a beauty queen who became his second wife and his five children from three marriages. But more surprising to many voters than the complexity of Trump\u2019s \u201cModern Family\u201d personal life is that it is not stopping them from voting for him.",
        "Roger Ailes, the former GOP political operative who oversaw the creation of the Fox News Channel and turned it into the leading voice of American conservatism, is in final negotiations to leave as chief executive of the network amid a budding sexual harassment scandal, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations. The agreement is expected to be completed shortly, the person said. Ailes, 76, has been chairman and chief executive of Fox since its inception in 1996, and he is often described as one of the most powerful figures in American media and politics.",
        "CLEVELAND T he Trump campaign has lately alternated between disaster and farce: the awkward rollout of Mike Pence, the botched logo, two parliamentary disputes on the convention floor, a muddled message, a plagiarized speech by the first lady.

        "CLEVELAND \u2014 The Republican Party must reject all of the fundamental ideas and values that underpin Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy, Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Tuesday afternoon in Cleveland. Although he didn\u2019t actually name Trump, Kasich\u2019s comments were the clearest and most comprehensive rebuke of Trump\u2019s foreign policy that any Republican has made here in Cleveland. Most of the Republican leaders speaking at the convention have decided to whitewash or water down their criticism of Trump\u2019s national security ideas in an effort to project party unity.",
        "Lakeview Cemetery is about a 20 minute drive from Cleveland\u2019s Quicken Loans Arena, the Republican National Convention site, but it might as well be a million miles away. Serene and green, the undulating funerary garden affords a panoramic vista of Lake Erie. On its highest hill stands the Garfield Memorial, a sandstone pillar dedicated to James A. Garfield, the 20th president of the United States, a Republican \u2014 and a native son of northeast Ohio. Someone should organize a field trip for every one of this year\u2019s GOP delegates.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 The first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention was purportedly about national security. In fact, it was about portraying liberalism as an ideology of national betrayal. Speaker after speaker intimated that President Obama, Hillary Clinton or both are directly responsible for a variety of American deaths because they value the lives of foreigners over those of their countrymen. The evening took an early dip into the gutter when Republicans trotted out Patricia Smith, a grieving mother of a man who died in the Benghazi attacks, who practically accused Hillary Clinton of murdering her child.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: So Melania Trump\u2019s speech last night apparently lifted a big chunk from Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 convention speech. As of this morning, the Trump campaign has offered two explanations for this. Top Trump adviser Paul Manafort claimed early today that the notion that Ms. Trump plagiarized Ms. Obama is \u201cjust really absurd,\u201d adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no cribbing of Michelle Obama\u2019s speech. These were common words and values. She cares about her family. To think that she\u2019d be cribbing Michelle Obama\u2019s words is crazy.",

In October, it\u2019ll be 20 years since boss Roger Ailes and visionary media mogul Rupert Murdoch launched their stab at giving the rest of America a voice on the cable airwaves.

        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump is adding fuel to Wall Street anxiety about his candidacy, jabbing directly at big banks this week with new language in the official Republican Party platform that calls for the restoration of the 1933 Act, a move that would force the breakup of large financial institutions. The embrace of the controversial law, long championed on the left, is deepening the estrangement of the sector from the presumptive Republican nominee, according to industry leaders and lobbyists, who are now struggling to assess what role and influence they would have in a Trump administration.",
        "Last week, before the recent avalanche of news, Bernie Sanders finally endorsed Hillary Clinton, ending a bitter primary contest. Donald Trump immediately tweeted an invitation to Sanders voters to join his campaign: But could Trump actually woo many disillusioned Sanders supporters into his camp come November? No. A survey last month from PRRI and the Brookings Institution shows that this is fantasy. Sanders supporters\u2019 political priorities are quite different from those of most Trump supporters.
