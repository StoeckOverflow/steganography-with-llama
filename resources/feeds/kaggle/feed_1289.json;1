        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign finally admitted on Wednesday that parts of Melania Trump\u2019s convention speech had been plagiarized, releasing a brief statement from the person responsible. \u201dMy name is Meredith McIver,\u201d it began, \u201dand I\u2019m an staff writer at the Trump Organization.\u201d McIver explains how she was working with Melania on the speech when the candidate\u2019s wife read out some passages from Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 convention speech. Those passages were then accidentally included in the draft Trump used, for which McIver, later in the note, apologizes. Done and done; the truth has come out. But there\u2019s another problem.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 For a fleeting moment, Tiffany Trump started to show people the character of her father. A friend of hers had passed away and \u201cthe first call I got, as I knew I would, came from my father,\u201d the said in her Tuesday night address here to the Republican National Convention. But her story cut off right there. What Donald Trump said to comfort her, she did not say.",
        "There are two reasons that Donald Trump Jr. was the star of the second night of the Republican convention. One reason is that his competition was largely people like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Sen. Dan Sullivan ( ) career politicians who, in the classic politician sense, offered comments that fell neatly into the bracket of acceptability, usually with room to spare at the edges. There were other speakers, including Trump\u2019s sister Tiffany, the head of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a small businessman from the Bronx. They were all fine, but Trump Jr.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Even before Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination, the billionaire brander and reality TV star was promising that he would put on a convention spectacle unlike any that had ever come before. The one that had nominated Mitt Romney four years ago in Tampa was \u201cthe single most boring convention I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said in an interview with The Washington Post in April. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to put some showbiz into a convention. Otherwise, people are going to fall asleep,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the people who know how to put showbiz into a convention.",
        "With the official nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has the opponent of her dreams \u2014 someone whose character, preparation and views are so defective as to make last night\u2019s roll call a devastating moment in the lives of many Republicans. The GOP has had magnificent nominees (Abraham Lincoln) and likable nominees (Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower). It\u2019s had admirable nominees who lost (Mitt Romney) and flawed nominees who won (Richard Nixon).",
        "The theme of the Republican National Convention\u2019s second night was \u201cMake America Work Again. \u201d As Tuesday came to an end, we knew no more about what Donald Trump and the party that officially nominated him would do to make America work again. As FiveThirtyEight pointed out, words like \u201cjob\u201d and \u201cbusiness\u201d \u2014 terms one would during with a night focused on the economy \u2014 were frequently missing from the evening\u2019s speeches. So much for \u201cMake America Work Again. \u201d https: . #GOPConvention pic. twitter.",
        "Keep an eye on Donald Trump Jr. Whatever happens in November, however a defeated Donald Trump would handle being a loser, Trump Jr. doesn\u2019t seem like someone who\u2019s inclined to fade away into plutocratic obscurity. He sounds like a potential future candidate \u2014 one who may come with sharper skills and less egomaniacal baggage than his father. In short: Beware. With his gelled, hair, the evokes Gordon Gekko.",
        "THE THEME of this year\u2019s Republican National Convention was visible early, in the \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d being hawked outside the arena. Republicans expanded on it during the first night of speakers, when a macabre parade of the grieving blamed the deaths of loved ones directly on Hillary Clinton. It descended to a new low Tuesday night when delegates assembled in Cleveland kept repeating their favorite chant: \u201cLock her up! Lock her up!\u201d \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d is emblazoned on the walls of the convention hall, but \u201clock her up\u201d captures the frenzied, angry mood.",
        "Roger Ailes, the creator and chief of the Fox News Channel, is being forced out of his position atop the conservative media hierarchy in the wake of a series of sexual harassment allegations begun by former Fox personality Gretchen Carlson. While this might seem like just an story, it\u2019s much, much more than that. In fact, Ailes\u2019 downfall is one of the most consequential events in years when it comes to the evolution of the conservative movement and even the fate of the Republican Party.",
        "Chrys P. Kefalas was a candidate in the 2016 Republican primary for U. S. Senate in Maryland. Tonight, voters around the country will hear directly from the man the Republican Party has nominated for vice president. If Indiana Gov. Mike Pence wants to head off months of negative stories about his long record of discrimination and intolerance, now is his chance to show that he is accepting of all Americans \u2014 including LGBT Americans \u2014 and affirm his commitment to a Republican Party that leaves no one behind. Now, that may require a change of heart \u2014 and mind.",
        "A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that Texas\u2019s strict law discriminates against minority voters, and it ordered a lower court to come up with a fix for the law in time for the November elections. The full U. S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, one of the most conservative in the country, declined to strike down the law completely but said provisions must be made to allow those who lack the specific ID the law requires to be able to cast a vote.",
        "Two weeks. That\u2019s all it took from Gretchen Carlson\u2019s filing a sexual harassment suit against Fox News chief Roger Ailes to the evident demise of one of the most powerful figures in American media and politics. With Ailes\u2019s departure expected as early as Friday (the exit terms reportedly are being negotiated) it was an fall from great heights. After all, it was Ailes \u2014 a former consultant to Richard Nixon and two other Republican presidents \u2014 who, from the network\u2019s beginning in 1996, drove its ratings and legendary profitability.",

Attorney General Eric Holder has been hired by Airbnb to help craft an policy for the company, which has come under fire in recent months following complaints of racial bias by its hosts.

        "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s new prime minister, Theresa May, has again confounded expectations. When she stood up at the dispatch box for her first Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on Wednesday, not many expected May \u2014 often described as a cautious, pragmatic politician \u2014 to let it rip during the weekly contest in the House of Commons.

        "Unprompted, White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Wednesday mentioned Sen. Timothy M. Kaine ( .) as someone President Obama would recommend to Hillary Clinton as a pick. Earnest confirmed that Obama has weighed in on Clinton\u2019s vetting process, but the spokesman did not say exactly what advice the president gave. He tossed out Kaine\u2019s name as someone qualified. Many Democrats see Kaine as the leading candidate to join Clinton on the ticket. She is expected to name a running mate as soon as Friday. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Obama was among those providing advice to Clinton.",
        "Four years before Hillary Clinton became the first woman to mathematically capture a major U. S. political party\u2019s presidential nomination, a staff member on Rick Santorum\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign posed a question in an email that shocked many people: \u201cIs it God\u2019s highest desire, that is, his biblically expressed will, \u2026 to have a woman rule the institutions of the family, the church, and the state?\u201d God\u2019s will or not, in 2016, it\u2019s all that much closer to coming to fruition. Clinton is poised to be nominated for president by the Democratic Party next week.",
        "This post has been updated with details about how Clinton decided to write a thesis about Saul Alinsky. Saul Alinsky and Lucifer made appearances at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night. It\u2019s not clear who was supposed to be scarier. In his speech, Ben Carson offered his own case against Hillary Clinton. It had a lot to do with tying her to Alinsky \u2014 and, by extension, the devil. Here\u2019s what he said: Now, one of the things that I have learned about Hillary Clinton is that one of her heroes, her mentors was Saul Alinsky.",

        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump and his people were trying to make something here in Cleveland this week, but precisely what seemed unclear, despite the themes they laid out for the four nights of the Republican National Convention. Make. Make. Make. Make. America. America. America. America. Safe on Monday. Work on Tuesday. First on Wednesday. One on Thursday. And Trump himself every single night. A great American concept, perhaps, but how was it going over as the party\u2019s reality \u2014 or unreality \u2014 show was being televised nationally from the Q? A lot of contradictions, mostly.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s pointed refusal to endorse Donald Trump during his address here at the Republican National Convention has reopened wounds from the GOP primary, threatening further divisions in a party already struggling to unite behind their nominee. [Latest updates from the convention] During a contentious breakfast here Thursday morning with the Texas delegation \u2014 some in the group booed and heckled their senator \u2014 Cruz delivered a lengthy defense of his exhortation to Republicans the night before to \u201cvote your conscience.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Tonight Donald Trump will give the speech of his life. The question isn\u2019t just whether Trump can regain control of the GOP convention house of horrors and project a reassuring aura of competence and stability after Ted Cruz\u2019s refusal to endorse him unleashed rage and bedlam that continues to resonate this morning. It\u2019s also whether he can use the occasion to broaden his appeal in a way that the previous nights, which were focused on riling up the GOP base with calls to imprison Hillary Clinton, arguably did not.",

        "CLEVELAND \u2014 For every Gov. John Kasich (who stayed away) or Sen. Ted Cruz (who came but did not endorse) there are a dozen Republican bigwigs in Cleveland who believe Donald Trump is unfit to be president but have endorsed him anyway. How do they live with their decisions? These are politicians who are privately persuaded that Trump is too ignorant, too narcissistic, too potentially tyrannical, not genuinely conservative \u2014 or some combination of the above. So how to justify an endorsement? I\u2019ve had a chance to ask some of them on the sidelines of the convention this week.",
        "A MAJOR theme of the Republican convention so far has been that a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to restore America\u2019s position in world affairs, which President Obama has, in the GOP view, deliberately undermined. Mr. Trump \u201cwill rebuild our military and stand with our allies,\u201d vice presidential nominee Mike Pence proclaimed. He also said: \u201cWe cannot have four more years of apologizing to our enemies and abandoning our friends. \u201d In reality, Mr. Trump\u2019s political rise has already disturbed traditional American allies and encouraged adversaries such as Russia, because of the candidate\u2019s own disparagement of U.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s comments Wednesday about a new U.

He meant every word and will do what he said whether Europeans and Republicans like it or not, according to his chief policy adviser.
