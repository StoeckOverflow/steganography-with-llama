        "Police in South Florida shot an unarmed black caretaker Monday as he tried to help his autistic patient. Charles Kinsey was trying to retrieve a young autistic man who had wandered away from an assisted living facility and was blocking traffic when Kinsey was shot by a North Miami police officer. The North Miami Police Department said they were responding to a call about an armed man threatening suicide, but they have released few other details about the shooting itself.",
        "The White House on Thursday announced an array of new initiatives aimed at clinching one key goal in a transition away from burning fossil fuels \u2014 switching the nation\u2019s millions of drivers from gas guzzlers to electric vehicles. The key to this transition? Installing a widespread national network of electric vehicle charging stations that will allow potential drivers to get around a key psychological problem: \u201crange anxiety. \u201d At present, many people are justifiably afraid that they\u2019ll run out of charge on their EV far from a station where they can repower its battery.",
        "Activist A. J. Bohannon had organized more than 1, 000 Black Lives Matters protesters to march the streets of Wichita on Sunday. But then, days before, he received a call from the new police chief with a different idea. Instead of having an event that drew a hard line between protester and police, why not bring them all together for an evening of summer revelry and open dialogue? So instead of marching, they gathered in a wooded park where the police department cooked and served up burgers. The officers played basketball with kids. They took group selfies.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazilian researchers said Thursday they have found Zika in Culex mosquitoes in the northeastern city of Recife in what could prove to be an important discovery. But they cautioned that more study was needed. Until now, Zika was believed to be carried mainly by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is much less numerous, lives in clean water and is more likely to bite during the day. Aedes aegypti thrives in tropical and subtropical climates \u2014 it is found in Southern U. S.",
        "PARIS \u2014 The man who plowed a truck into a crowd during Bastille Day celebrations in the Riviera city of Nice last week \u2014 killing at least 84 and injuring more than 300 \u2014 plotted his attack for months and had accomplices, the Paris prosecutor announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters here in the French capital, Fran\u00e7ois Molins said an analysis of the attacker\u2019s cellphone revealed photographs and search histories suggesting that Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, the driver of the truck, had contemplated an attack as early as 2015.",
        "Sen. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack remain two of the leading contenders for Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, but Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey is also under active consideration, according to a Democrat with knowledge of the process. Booker, a freshman senator and former mayor of Newark, has drawn relatively little attention throughout Clinton\u2019s selection process but remains a serious prospect. He was among the roughly potential running mates who met with Clinton at her home in Washington on Friday, a fact first reported Thursday by Politico.",
        "Summer is the time for tiki drinks and roof decks, for finger food and . And that\u2019s why, at restaurants with a strict dress code, summer is the time for awkward conversations. Conversations like: Excuse me, sir, are not permitted in the dining room. Or: Excuse me, sir, may we suggest that you go back to your hotel room to change? In the summertime, people dress casually and \u201cthink they\u2019re allowed everywhere with that dress code,\u201d says Adnane Kebaier, maitre d\u2019 at Marcel\u2019s, which requires jackets in the dining room.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s about time we started to take photography seriously and treat it as a hobby,\u201d says Elliott Erwitt, the acclaimed eternal amateur and member of Magnum Photos since 1953. Erwitt is known for his ability to capture moments of humor and irony in everyday life. His work ranges from portraits of cultural figures to witty photographs of dogs. An exhibition that examines that span will be on display at The Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas Austin. \u201cElliott Erwitt: Home Around the World\u201d will feature more than 200 photographs, including classic Erwitt images and lesser known surprises.",
        "MUNICH \u2014 A shooting rampage in a busy shopping area of Munich left at least eight people dead Friday and sparked a manhunt for as many as three gunmen who fled the scene after carrying out an act of \u201csuspected terrorism,\u201d authorities said. Police later reported a ninth fatality and said they were trying to verify whether a gunman committed suicide. No other details were immediately available. \u201cWe believe there are three perpetrators,\u201d a police spokesman told reporters earlier. \u201cThey are still at large.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 A traumatized Republican Party came here hoping for an group therapy session. The GOP at large would talk through its differences, remind itself of what it shares, then head into the fall election with a renewed sense of identity. Instead, the week laid bare the fact that the party has become a collection of warring tribes, with no coherent set of principles beyond a burning desire to keep Hillary Clinton out of the White House.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump on Friday revived an unsubstantiated accusation that Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s father met with the man who killed president John F. Kennedy, swiftly casting aside the uncharacteristically restrained persona on display when he accepted the GOP presidential nomination one night before. The celebrity mogul set about \u2014 unprompted \u2014 to refute charges put forward by Cruz earlier in the week that he had attacked the senator\u2019s wife and father, Heidi and Rafael, during the GOP primary.",
        "Donald Trump has, through the course of his presidential campaign, turned press conference into a sort of performance art. On Friday, he turned in another classic a seat of your pants thrill ride that stood in stark contrast to the more and formal acceptance speech he gave on Thursday night in Cleveland. Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me! To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript. TRUMP: Thank you very much. We had an amazing convention. That was one of the best.",
        "Ivanka Trump, the eldest Trump daughter, has been a perennial presence on the campaign trail. But on Thursday night, she went where no advocate for a Republican presidential nominee has ventured in primetime before: She spoke explicitly about the gender wage gap and the plight of working mothers. \u201cSingle women without children earn 94 cents for each dollar earned by a man, whereas married mothers made only 77 cents,\u201d Ivanka declared. \u201dGender is no longer the factor creating the greatest wage discrepancy in this country, motherhood is. \u201d Was another Trump woman borrowing lines from the Democrats?",
        "[Donald Trump\u2019s dark acceptance speech, annotated] President Obama on Friday offered his first response to the Republican National Convention, blasting the vision painted by Donald Trump and other Republicans of a country \u201don the verge of collapse\u201d as a fiction that does not match reality. \u201dThe one thing that I think is important to recognize is this idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn\u2019t really jibe with the experience of most people,\u201d Obama said during a news conference at the White House.",
        "As the speaker at the Republican convention, Ivanka Trump had two goals. First, to leverage her likability on behalf of the next speaker, her father. And second, to demonstrate to women that Donald Trump was the sort of candidate who would have their backs. \u201dMy father values talent,\u201d Ivanka Trump said. \u201dHe recognizes real knowledge and skill when he finds it. He is color blind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period.\u201d At her father\u2019s company, she said, \u201dthere are more female than male executives.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 From Aimee Winder Newton\u2019s perch at the back of the convention floor, Donald Trump started on the right note. Newton had come to Cleveland seeking reassurance about the man whose incendiary, pompous personality left her worried that for the first time in her life she might not be able to support her party\u2019s presidential nominee. Then Trump came on stage and said he \u201chumbly\u201d accepted the nomination. And though his exhaustive and dark address would still give her pause, Newton felt confident by the end that she could make a decision. \u201cI can do this,\u201d she said.",
        "ORLANDO \u2014 Hillary Clinton remained mum about her selection of a running mate Friday, with Sen. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey all under consideration, according to a Democrat with knowledge of the process. Clinton\u2019s campaign, which was expected to unveil her pick as early as Friday afternoon in a text message, had not made an announcement by early evening, amid a busy day on the campaign trail and a shooting rampage in Munich that dominated headlines.",
        "As Hillary Clinton prepared to announce her 2016 running mate, a trove of nearly 20, 000 emails were released by WikiLeaks on Friday, providing an embarrassing inside look at Democratic Party operations on the eve of the Democrats\u2019 national convention. The emails from the Democratic National Committee include discussions of Clinton\u2019s chief rival for the presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( . ); details of perks provided to party donors attending the convention; and email exchanges between party officials, journalists and others.",
        "DONALD J. TRUMP, until now a Republican problem, this week became a challenge the nation must confront and overcome. The real estate tycoon is uniquely unqualified to serve as president, in experience and temperament. He is mounting a campaign of snarl and sneer, not substance. To the extent he has views, they are wrong in their diagnosis of America\u2019s problems and dangerous in their proposed solutions. Mr. Trump\u2019s politics of denigration and division could strain the bonds that have held a diverse nation together.",
        "CLEVELAND The notions that Donald Trump would make a typical presidential pivot, and that his divisive form of politics was merely a pose, lie dead on the convention floor in Cleveland. And it is now necessary to confront his unmasked contempt for American institutions. Far from being confused or opportunistic, Trump has a consistent, view of the universe and his (prominent) place within it. The world is in chaos. Our country is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants and \u201cmassive . . . flows\u201d of disloyal, unscreened refugees.",
        "It remains to be seen whether the Republican National Convention will generate a \u201cbump\u201d in polling and, if so, whether that has any implications for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. Given how unliked both candidates are and how polarized the electorate is, it is very possible not much will change in the race. Nevertheless, judging by a whole array of factors, one cannot help but conclude this was the least successful convention since the Pat 1992 shindig that became the staging ground for another round in the culture wars. Let\u2019s assess the convention by a number of criteria.",
        "I\u2019m sure the readers of Spoiler Alerts are drowning in hot takes after Donald Trump\u2019s acceptance speech last night. I\u2019ll therefore keep this short and sweet: Unless you were already converted to The World According to Donald, it was a bad speech. In particular: Trump\u2019s primary theme was that he would be the law and order candidate. He pledged that \u201cBeginning on January 20, 2017, safety will be restored.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 We have always been at war with Eurasia. Snowball the Pig is responsible for everything that is wrong on the farm. How fortunate we are to have Donald Trump. Donald Trump is the miracle product that will fix everything that is wrong in your home. He is also your father figure (put your little hand in his) who will be your preacher, teacher (everything you had in mind). He\u2019ll be your dream, your wish, your fantasy, your hope, your love, everything that you need. Truly, madly, deeply, he loves you.",
        "CLEVELAND It was a grand old party at Quicken Loans Arena on Thursday night. Delegates wore cowboy hats, straw hats, tricorn hats, stovepipe hats, cheesehead hats, evergreen hats and Uncle Sam hats. They bopped to the music of a band and waved red, white and blue pompoms. There was a Donald Trump action figure here, a Donald Trump superhero cape there \u2014 and little sign of the NeverTrump dissension that marred the early days of the convention. But as the hour grew late, just after Ivanka Trump declared brightly that \u201ccome Jan.",
        "Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s decision to restore voting rights to more than 200, 000 felons violates Virginia\u2019s constitution, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday, dealing a major blow to the Democratic governor with implications for the November presidential race in the crucial swing state. In a decision, the court ruled that McAuliffe overstepped his clemency powers by issuing a sweeping order in April restoring rights to all who are no longer incarcerated or on probation or parole.",
        "A series of startling shootings by police, including one this week of a Florida therapist wounded by police gunfire while helping an autistic man, have been captured in graphic detail on video, prompting renewed demands to retrain and reform America\u2019s police departments. Two of the shootings fueled a violent response: Black military veterans Micah X. Johnson and Gavin Eugene Long staged attacks in Dallas and Baton Rouge, respectively, that left eight officers dead in the span of 11 days.",
        "Authorities in North Miami, Fla. said Friday that they had placed a second police officer on leave as part of the investigation into a police shooting there earlier this week in which an officer shot and wounded an unarmed man. The second officer was placed on unpaid administrative leave because of \u201cconflicting statements given to the investigators\u201d looking into the shooting, Larry M. Spring Jr. the North Miami city manager, said at a news conference. The shooting Monday captured widespread attention after footage emerged showing the moments before the incident.",
        "Officials in Austin are investigating the violent arrest of a black elementary school teacher who was by a white police officer during a traffic stop. The investigation comes after the emergence of police video footage showing not only the June 2015 arrest but also a scene afterward, when another white officer told the teacher that cops are wary of blacks because of their \u201cviolent tendencies\u201d and \u201cintimidating\u201d appearance. \u201c percent of the time \u2026 it is the black community that is being violent,\u201d the officer tells her. \u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of white people are afraid.",
        "Sen. Timothy M. Kaine ( .) is one of a few people that Hillary Clinton is considering as a potential candidate. On the one hand, Kaine is the kind of moderate Democrat who would make a sensible, prudent choice for a presidential candidate looking for a running mate in a hotly contested general election. On the other hand, the Democratic Party has shifted to the left in recent years, putting Kaine\u2019s centrist positions on several major issues out of line with the direction of the party. Here\u2019s a look at where Kaine stands on three of those questions.",
        "Many of the most circulated names for Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential pick are Catholic \u2014 a fact that both says a lot about the influence of America\u2019s huge Catholic population, but also reveals, when you look more closely, how far the country has moved away from basic religious tribalism. Clinton on Friday chose U. S. Sen. Tim Kaine ( .) a former missionary who personally opposes abortion and who pleased advocates earlier in his political career by saying he would aim to reduce the number of abortions by promoting adoption and abstinence education."
