        "Take a cursory glance and all would seem to be well between evangelicals, Donald Trump and the GOP. Jerry Falwell Jr. president of the huge evangelical Liberty University, gave a address Thursday, the grand finale of this week\u2019s Republican National Convention. And a recent Pew Research poll showed that 78 percent of white \u201cevangelicals\u201d \u2014 and an overwhelming majority of evangelicals are white \u2014 plan to vote for Trump this fall. However, polls that look into voter attitude show that many evangelicals are far from enamored with Trump.",
        "Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is running for the U. S. Senate, linking his decision to Donald Trump\u2019s bid for the presidency and the business mogul\u2019s proposals on trade and immigration. Duke, a vocal Trump supporter, announced his candidacy for the seat in Louisiana on Friday and said he was \u201coverjoyed\u201d to see the businessman\u2019s campaign \u201cembrace most of the issues that I\u2019ve championed for years,\u201d including the nationalist and protectionist notion of \u201cAmerica First.",
        "YUSHU COUNTY, CHINA \u2014 As he gazes out across the rolling grasslands of the Tibetan plateau, where hundreds of his yaks are grazing, Awang Chumpey is less than happy. The land he shares with his neighbors is dotted with thousands of tiny burrows, home to a colony of plateau pika that he blames for eating his animals\u2019 grass. A smaller relative of the rabbit, the plateau pika occupies an almost identical ecological niche to the United States\u2019 prairie dog. And it is equally unpopular in many rural communities. \u201cOver the years the grass has become very bad,\u201d Awang said.",
        "(Michael Robinson Washington Post) Thousands of people descended on Cleveland this week for the Republican National Convention. Even before the convention started, controversy and conflict were expected as both black power and white supremacist groups said they would be showing up in the streets, and others said they would be openly carrying firearms to show their support for the Second Amendment.",
        "MIAMI \u2014 The newly formed Democratic ticket took the stage together for the first time in Miami, showing off a partnership that prizes steadiness over flashiness. As Hillary Clinton presented her choice, Virginia Sen. Timothy M. Kaine, to a roaring crowd of supporters, she noted that her choice stood in clear contrast to the Republican nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. \u201dSenator Tim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not,\u201d Clinton said.",
        "PHILADELPHIA  \u201d After Donald Trump presented a dark picture of the country at his convention in Cleveland last week, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats plan to project a more optimistic and inclusive vision of the future when they convene here starting Monday. But the challenge for Clinton and her newly minted running mate, Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (Va.) will be to avoid becoming cheerleaders for the status quo and instead infuse that hopeful tone into an argument for change that could galvanize a frustrated and divided electorate.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The Democratic Party arrived here still divided over the results of its presidential primary season, with anger at the nominating process, the ticket and hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee spilling into the party\u2019s final meetings before the convention begins. On each count, supporters of Bernie Sanders found new reasons to bristle about their choice in November. Hillary Clinton\u2019s selection of Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (Va.) as her running mate angered progressives who had lobbied for someone from their movement.",
        "Timothy M. Kaine was feeling bummed by the time he walked into the fundraiser he was hosting with his friend and political partner Mark Warner. Kaine, then Virginia\u2019s governor, was on Barack Obama\u2019s shortlist to become the Illinois senator\u2019s nominee. But Kaine had seen a news report that \u201crepeated the \u2018no significant accomplishment\u2019 line\u201d about his tenure in Richmond, as he would later put it in a memo to his staff, and was \u201cin a down mood. \u201d Things got worse.",
        "In tapping Sen. Timothy M. Kaine ( .) as her running mate, Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t just choose the popular former governor of a purple state that she hopes will turn out for Democrats in November. She also chose one half of a Virginia power couple with a history of public service and advocacy on issues related to child welfare and education. As governor, Kaine championed early childhood education, a cornerstone of Clinton\u2019s education platform, and pushed for more money to support public preschool.",
        "Housing Secretary Julian Castro was long touted as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton, but when the call came Friday informing him that the presumptive Democratic nominee had picked someone else, he wasn\u2019t entirely surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, of course,\u201d Castro said in a telephone interview Saturday morning, \u201cbut it\u2019s also easy to put into perspective. When I was 30 years old, I lost a very close mayor\u2019s race. At the time I was completely disappointed and crushed.",
        "MUNICH \u2014 City authorities here said Saturday that the teenage gunman who went on a rampage at a shopping center Friday, leaving nine people dead, had no ties to the Islamic State or other extremist groups. Instead, police say, they think he was \u201cobsessed\u201d with mass killings and may have been a depressed loner who was bullied in school. The southern German city\u2019s police chief said investigators searching the assailant\u2019s family apartment found a trove of electronic data and written materials suggesting that he was fascinated by shooting rampages before he went on one of his own Friday afternoon.",

        "One day in early June, an embattled but determined news anchor, a public relations man and a group of attorneys settled into chairs around the conference table on the 35th floor of a law office on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. Gretchen Carlson\u2019s tenure as an host at Fox News was imperiled, and she knew it. For the previous nine months she\u2019d been quietly meeting with attorneys to craft a lawsuit against her boss, the Fox News chairman, Roger Ailes.",

Scribner. 535 pp. $18 While Donald Trump claims to be our voice, Hillary Clinton forever struggles to find hers. Her speech Thursday at the Democratic National Convention will afford her yet another chance to argue her case, to explain why she\u2019s the best person for the presidency. For Clinton, whom we\u2019ve known so well and so long, that\u2019s a challenge.",
        "Few political careers and presidencies have been more defined by speeches than Barack Obama\u2019s. His 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention vaulted him into the country\u2019s consciousness. His 2008 speech on race saved his faltering presidential campaign. As president, Obama\u2019s biggest and most consequential moments \u2014 his unfulfilled outreach to the Muslim world in Cairo, his Nobel Peace Prize address on the grim necessity of war in Oslo and his eulogy for nine slain parishioners in Charleston, S. C. \u2014 often have been speeches. Obama\u2019s best oratory is beautifully written, meticulously crafted and theatrically delivered.",
        "The tumult over Melania Trump\u2019s speech this past week at the Republican National Convention \u2014 a search for a plagiarist that turned up an writer for the Trump Organization \u2014 was an anomaly: Speechwriters are rarely figures of public note. If we have a creed, it is to cultivate \u201ca passion for anonymity,\u201d as the Brownlow Committee implored presidential staff in 1937. Most manage that pretty well, keeping out of the spotlight so it stays trained on the boss. The job is more often than not a quiet grind.",
        "The heat wave that barbecued the Midwest this past week is the East Coast this weekend. With temperatures and humidity indexes hitting triple digits, city dwellers have no choice but to keep thermostat settings low and energy consumption high. But we need air conditioning because we use air conditioning, and that circular logic is getting worse as global temperatures rise. Over the past American cities have taken on an unstable thermodynamic form, coming to resemble collections of boxes full of cool air crowded onto concrete heat islands.",
        "My brother and I sat in stiff chairs in a government office, a clipboard of paperwork in front of us. He\u2019d recently moved, and we were there to sign him up for health care. Flipping through the papers, he came upon a form. \u201cPeople like me can vote?\u201d my brother asked. I had to look away from him for a moment so that I wouldn\u2019t cry in the middle of the waiting room. Like millions of Americans, my older brother lives with a disability. He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which means he hears voices and battles mood fluctuations.",
        "How do Americans think about the role of race in our country\u2019s daily life? News reports, social media and uncomfortable dinner conversations often point to one conclusion: They disagree. Many white Americans believe that the United States has entered a phase; many black Americans believe that race is as salient an issue as ever. Recent polling identifies one area, though, where black and white Americans show remarkable convergence: They believe that race relations have gotten worse.",
        "You can trace the name Fox in the news industry back through various corporate iterations until you get to the Fox News Service, part of Fox Film, which merged with Twentieth Century Pictures in 1935 to form 20th Century Fox. Fox News Service was in the newsreel business, as Fox News today is in the cable news business. And in 1927, it had a problem. \u201dThe Fox News Service,\u201d Donald Crafton wrote in his book \u201dThe Talkies,\u201d \u201dwas far behind the leader, [film studio] Path\u00e9.",
        "When Christian Garcia spotted two people having sex behind a dumpster outside the Gainesville, Fla. bar where he was working security early Thursday morning, he at first passed it off as drunken antics. But then the University of Florida linebacker realized the woman \u2014 who was being pressed against the dumpster \u2014 was unconscious, according to CBS Miami. \u201cI mean, at that point, I\u2019m like, this isn\u2019t right,\u201d Garcia told CBS affiliate . \u201cThis girl is probably drunk, there\u2019s no possible way she could\u2019ve given consent.",
        "As the Democratic National Convention unfolds in Philly this week, the scene will be dominated once again by three familiar faces. Bill, Barack and Hillary are not exactly the Three Amigos, no love lost among them at various moments, but time and circumstance have entwined their stories and legacies more tightly than ever.

        "In the summer before 1992\u2019s presidential election, the toy company Mattel, which had given Barbie a series of historically masculine professions \u2014 astronaut in 1965, surgeon in 1973 \u2014 decided to award its famous doll a new role: presidential candidate. Candidate Barbie wore a ball gown. The dress had a silver bustier and a skirt, and its wearer\u2019s hair fell in waves to her waist. It was an outfit entirely inappropriate for the campaign trail, but then again, it was Barbie.",
        "The relationship outside the classroom began over the phone, using a messenger app popular with teenagers called Kik. She was a and he was her speech teacher at Euless Junior High in Euless, Tex. The pair sent messages to one another nearly every day over Christmas break, according to an arrest warrant affidavit cited by ABC affiliate WFAA. By February, they were seeing each other outside of school and engaging in a physical relationship, the victim would later tell police.",
        "Some quick thinking and a sturdy rope saved a young black bear in Glenwood Springs, Colo. from certain death this week. The 2 bear had its head stuck in an empty bucket of cheese puffs and could not free itself \u2014 meaning it also couldn\u2019t eat, said Perry Will, area wildlife manager with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. But as area residents spotted the bear and notified wildlife officials, the critter always scurried away before help could arrive. Then Jim Hawkins, 66, took matters into his own hands.",
        "When GB experienced violence from her first partner as a teenager, she struggled to identify the relationship as abusive. For GB, who spoke on condition that she be identified only by her initials, the abuse began with behavior and hurtful words. Within months, she says, this behavior escalated into physical and sexual violence. GB describes her former partner holding her down, choking and penetrating her, as well as hitting her into submission, \u201cwhen I clearly stated that I was not in the mood for sex at the time.",
        "I\u2019m just guessing here, but this probably isn\u2019t what restaurant owner Joe Melluso was expecting, when he procured this really, really big lobster. To be honest, it\u2019s probably not what the lobster was expecting, either. But this week, the lobster \u2014 which was destined to become the dinner of some restaurant patron in South Florida \u2014 was saved from that fate. The crustacean has now been given a name, Larry. And, according to reports, Larry the lobster is headed to a new destination, too \u2014 the Maine State Aquarium.",
        "Most of us think of cash back or free flights when we consider the benefits of using credit cards. But many of them offer unique, often hidden, benefits outside their traditional rewards programs, perks that can save cardholders money and time. Often, the benefits are offered for simply having the card \u2014 no purchase required. \u201cThe marketplace is so competitive that banks are trying to bend over backwards to keep their customers and attract new ones,\u201d said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards. com. \u201cAnd perks are what they are doing to stand out.",
        "At the top of the page, I wrote, \u201cMom. \u201d Then the names of my four closest girlfriends: Liz, Leah, Carly and Courtney. Then my best guy friend; I\u2019d asked him to be my best man years before I knew whom I\u2019d marry. (My husband picked a best man, too.) Then came my aunt\u2019s names and so on until I\u2019d listed the 25 people I love the most, in descending order.",
        "I would not choose this life of domestic servitude. But I did choose to marry him. I do, I said. And I\u2019m not one to break promises. So I\u2019m here, in a remote corner of Africa, as an obediently trailing spouse. Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong, I rail against it, and I flail about trying to draw some sort of more substantial self from the dust. I am a Reluctant Housewife. Sometimes I call myself a writer. Sometimes a designer. Never a housewife (though that indubitably is what I am; without his earnings, we could barely afford to eat)."
