        "The festival is called Picklesburgh, and it\u2019s the kind of thing that could only happen here in Pittsburgh, a city with landmarks named after a manufacturer of sweet relish and kosher dills and, more famously, ketchup. But \u201cKetchupsburgh\u201d doesn\u2019t have quite as nice a ring to it. So for two days last week, the hometown of Heinz celebrated all things brined and fermented, with tents hawking pickled egg rolls and pickled funnel cake and pickles on a stick.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee said she will resign this week in the aftermath of the release of thousands of embarrassing internal email exchanges among Democratic officials. The episode had pitched the party into turmoil on the eve of a convention that was promised to showcase unity. \u201cI know that electing Hillary Clinton as our next president is critical for America\u2019s future,\u201d Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement released Sunday. \u201cI look forward to serving as a surrogate for her campaign in Florida and across the country to ensure her victory.",
        "Thousands of leaked emails have sealed the fate of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s uneven tenure as DNC chair. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s resignation announcement Sunday afternoon comes as a bad situation just keeps getting worse and appears as though it might continue to do so. That\u2019s because WikiLeaks has so far released nearly 20, 000 emails, new details are still being discovered, and there is still the prospect of additional, damaging emails coming to light. Many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 It has been an open secret for some time that one of the weakest elements of the extended Democratic Party family under President Obama has been the Democratic National Committee. This neglected institution has become a public embarrassment on the eve of a national convention designed to highlight party unity. The cascade of internal DNC emails released Friday by WikiLeaks underscore what Sen. Bernie Sanders and his advisers have long claimed: The DNC appeared to have its finger on the scale for rival Hillary Clinton through the long nominating contest.",
        "A top official with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign on Sunday accused the Russian government of orchestrating the release of damaging Democratic Party records to help the campaign of Republican Donald Trump \u2014 and some cybersecurity experts agree. The extraordinary charge came as some national security officials have been growing increasingly concerned about possible efforts by Russia to meddle in the election, according to several individuals familiar with the situation.",
        "For those who know Sen. Timothy M. Kaine well in his home state of Virginia, there is rich irony to the blowback from liberal advocacy groups upset that Hillary Clinton did not pick someone more progressive to be her Democratic running mate. \u201cThroughout his time in politics here, there has always been this question about whether Tim Kaine was too liberal for Virginia,\u201d said Bob Holsworth, a longtime political analyst. \u201cNo one has ever suggested this was a moderate who couldn\u2019t be counted on to support liberal values.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Nine years ago, Michelle Obama was a reluctant political spouse. The Chicago hospital executive made little secret of her distaste for the process as she stepped onto the national stage, calling partisan politics a cynical business. Her raw authenticity, at times, hurt her husband\u2019s campaign for the presidency. Today, the first lady is a fully evolved political superstar, hugely beloved within the Democratic Party and a force within popular culture.",
        "In the to the big unveiling of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s choice for her running mate, I was asked whom I thought that person would be. There was no question in my mind that the former secretary of state would tap current senator from Virginia Tim Kaine (D). Picking Kaine was a victory of planning over thinking. The latter would have seen Clinton prize a demographic niche above all else. I understand those demanding that she select \u201ca Latino,\u201d \u201ca true progressive,\u201d \u201can African American\u201d or \u201canother woman.",

He is the author of \u201cPresident Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime. \u201d The presidential nominee quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and Thomas Paine, the most radical of the Founding Fathers. He asked all Americans for their support. \u201cMore than anything else,\u201d he said, \u201cI want my candidacy to unify our country; to renew the American spirit and sense of purpose. I want to carry our message to every American, regardless of party affiliation, who is a member of this community of shared values.",

        "Sen. Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he would have liked to see Hillary Clinton pick a more progressive running mate, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( .) and offered tepid praise of her choice of Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (Va. ). After staying mum for a couple of days, Sanders, the in the Democratic primaries, weighed in during Sunday talk show appearances, calling Kaine \u201dvery, very smart\u201d and \u201da very nice guy.\u201d Sanders, a senator from Vermont, said Kaine is more conservative than he is, but is \u201d100 times better\u201d than the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.",
        "RICHMOND \u2014 Sen. Timothy M. Kaine, the presumptive Democratic nominee for vice president, went looking for prayers Sunday at the city church his family has long attended. Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, attended services as usual at St. Elizabeth Catholic Church, as he had promised to do in remarks alongside presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton one day earlier. As reporters swarmed around him, Kaine said he would limit his remarks to the church, where he and Anne have worshiped for decades.",
        "Only a few minutes into Donald Trump\u2019s acceptance speech Thursday night, he started his familiar attacks on the media: \u201cIf you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies and the media myths \u2014 the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there. \u201d Casting himself as Truth Teller In Chief, he doubled down: \u201cI will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper,\u201d he said.",
        "The Russian flag will be flying at the Summer Olympics, after all, as the International Olympic Committee decided Sunday that athletes from the nation mired in an ongoing drug scandal will be allowed to compete on the sporting world\u2019s largest stage next month in Rio de Janeiro. Less than two weeks before the start of the Rio Games, the International Olympic Committee ruled against barring Russia from the Summer Olympics but did approve measures that could reduce the number of Russian athletes participating.",

Two studies looked at how complex work and social engagement counteract the effects of unhealthy diet and cerebrovascular disease on cognition.",
        "Donald Trump this weekend defended longtime friend Roger Ailes, the ousted chief executive of Fox News who is accused of sexually harassing at least two dozen women. Trump also questioned the motives of some of the women. \u201dI can tell you that some of the women that are complaining, I know how much he\u2019s helped them, and even recently. And when they write books that are fairly recently released, and they say wonderful things about him.",

He had a wife and a teenage son, owned property, and \u201cworked odd jobs,\u201d according to the Tampa Bay Times. The only problem, police say, was that Terry Jude Symansky was not really Terry Jude Symansky. He was actually an Indiana man named Richard Hoagland who vanished 25 years ago and has been considered dead since 2003, the paper reported. The lie lasted more than two decades.",
        "Two years ago \u2014 an epoch in Silicon Valley time \u2014 AOL chief executive Tim Armstrong proposed a merger to Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer. Armstrong and Mayer are former Googlers hired to run and rescue these former marquee Internet destinations. But AOL and Yahoo were struggling in an increasingly mobile online world dominated by Google and Facebook. Mayer rejected Armstrong\u2019s offer.

        "Reader: My stepdaughter, a recent college graduate, is living with her dad and me while looking for a lab research position for which she\u2019d be qualified with an average GPA and a degree from a state school. She has had several phone interviews and one in person, but nothing more. Stepdaughter has a guttural Southern accent and poor diction.

        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Bernie Sanders closed out the first day of the Democratic party\u2019s convention with a forceful plea for his supporters to get behind the party\u2019s nominee Hillary Clinton. The Vermont senator spoke to a packed arena that had for hours swung wildly from unified highs to divided lows. \u201cBased on her ideas and her leadership, Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe choice is not even close. \u201d Even as he spoke, the reaction was mixed and emotions ran high.",

Many remain supporters of Bernie Sanders, and they were joined by people protesting police brutality, advocating immigrant rights and pushing for gun control.",
        "Bernie Sanders spoke to a large group of his supporters on Monday in Philadelphia. The crowd cheered as Sanders ran through all of the successes he and his \u201dpolitical revolution\u201d had run up this year: the millions of votes he won, the reduction in superdelegates, the takeover of state parties by Sanders supporters. Then came time for the pivot. Sanders tried to tell the crowd that now was the time to line up behind Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Timothy M. Kaine. Boos cascaded down. Shouts of \u201dno!\u201d And then a Sanders chant started up.",
        "As the Democratic National Convention begins in Philadelphia today, conventional wisdom is hardening behind this idea: Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president. That sentiment is driven by a Republican convention last week in Cleveland that showcased not only Trump\u2019s continued inability to stick to any sort of message but also the deep fissures his nomination has created within the Republican establishment. And all of that is true. It\u2019s also true that the electoral map clearly favors Clinton and that Trump is on the wrong side of the massive demographic changes sweeping the country.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren disappointed liberals when she decided not to run for president. Many on the left were dismayed again when she didn\u2019t make the cut as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, dashing dreams of an ticket that could rev up the Democratic base. But as she took the stage in prime time Monday night at the Democratic National Convention for perhaps the most anticipated speech of her career, Warren positioned herself to wield singular power over Democratic politics and the party\u2019s policy agenda from her perch in the Senate, no matter who wins the presidency. While Sen.",
        "It was September 2014, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz was tumbling through yet another terrible news cycle. A couple of dozen Democrats had just unloaded a litany of mostly anonymous complaints about her chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee in a mean, dishy Politico story; cable news pundits were salivating over her imminent demise. (\u201cHas Debbie Wasserman Schultz become kryptonite for the Democratic Party?\u201d an MSNBC segment pondered.) She woke up early that next morning, headed to a Starbucks on Capitol Hill and bumped into an odd source of comfort: speaker John A. Boehner.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: As the Democratic convention opens in Philadelphia, it\u2019s yet another morning as a new CNN poll shows Donald Trump gaining a large bounce from his own convention and going into the lead among registered voters nationally. We shouldn\u2019t take the polling between conventions all that seriously, as a number of observers (including your humble blogger) have pointed out.",
        "PHILADELPHIA En route to fight one of his many duels, French politician Georges Clemenceau bought a train ticket. Was he pessimistic? \u201cNot at all. I always use my opponent\u2019s return ticket for the trip back. \u201d Some Hillary Clinton advisers, although not that serene, think her victory is probable and can be assured. Her challenge is analogous to Ronald Reagan\u2019s in 1980, when voters were even more intensely dissatisfied than they now are. There were hostages in Iran, and stagflation\u2019s \u201cmisery index\u201d (the sum of the inflation and unemployment rates) was 21. 98."
