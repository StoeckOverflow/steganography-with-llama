        "In his recent interview with the New York Times, Donald Trump warned that the United States would defend only NATO allies who have \u201cfulfilled their obligations to us. \u201d He made clear that he sees allies as business partners, and relationships with them in transactional terms: Pay up or we won\u2019t protect you. This framing of alliance relationships as contracts misses the strategic value of allies to the United States.",
        "This excerpt is adapted from \u201cHillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis. \u201d In my culture, love of country used to be a civic religion. Our ancestral homeland in Appalachia \u2014 the birthplace of the grandparents who raised me \u2014 was Breathitt County, Ky. nicknamed \u201cbloody\u201d Breathitt.",
        "There. He came out and said it. \u201cI alone,\u201d averred Donald Trump in his speech Thursday night accepting the Republican nomination for president, can save America, save the world, save you. Rarely in modern political memory has a candidate so personalized a candidacy. Certainly, no other U. S. political figure comes to mind who dared make such an exclusive claim on truth and light. A savior complex may have befallen some of them, but who was bold enough to voice it so plainly as Trump?",
        "The emails of Sony employees. diplomatic cables. The addresses of married people who used a confidential dating service. Every time \u201csecret\u201d information is made public, the focus of attention is always, immediately, on the sensational details. The motives of the hacker, the leaker or the person in possession of the secret tapes are rarely examined. But what to do when that person has an ulterior motive quite far from \u201cthe public\u2019s right to know\u201d? And what if that person\u2019s motive is to help throw an American election? I am not asking this question in a vacuum.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 Nineteen people were stabbed to death at a care home for people with disabilities, Japanese media reported Tuesday, describing the worst attack in the postwar era in Japan. A man apparently aggrieved at having been fired from the facility in Sagamihara, west of Tokyo, went on the rampage at 2:30 a. m. local time. He killed 19 people and injured 26 more, a dozen seriously. They have been transported to nearby hospitals for treatment. NHK, the public broadcaster, aired footage of ambulances lined up outside the facility.",
        "Donald Trump claimed that Indian reservations had fallen under mob control. He secretly paid for more than $1 million in ads that portrayed members of a tribe in Upstate New York as cocaine traffickers and career criminals. And he suggested in testimony and in media appearances that Native Americans in Connecticut were faking their ancestry. \u201cI think I might have more Indian blood than a lot of the Indians that are trying to open up the reservations,\u201d Trump said during a 1993 radio interview with shock jock Don Imus.",
        "Last week, Donald Trump \u201chumbly and gratefully\u201d accepted the Republican nomination for president, putting an end to perhaps the most unpredictable primary season in recent history. And yet, this whole time, people still tried to predict it. Last summer at Trump\u2019s announcement and through the fall and winter, journalists called his victory \u201can extreme long shot,\u201d saying he was \u201cnot a real candidate\u201d and had \u201cno serious chance of winning\u201d. And people outside the news media seemed to agree.",
        "Donald Trump is trying to reignite a debate over international trade in an effort to weaken Hillary Clinton\u2019s support among voters, particularly in Rust Belt states such as Pennsylvania, where the Democratic National Convention kicks off Monday. In television interviews and on social media in recent days, Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton\u2019s running mate, Timothy M. Kaine, for praising the Partnership, a sweeping trade agreement that has turned off activists in both parties.",
        "When Yahoo officially shared the news Monday morning Verizon had agreed to buy it for $4. 8 billion, the next question for many was this one: What will happen to Yahoo\u2019s embattled chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who struggled for four years to turn around the aging Internet pioneer? Mayer said in a letter to employees that she wasn\u2019t planning to go anywhere. \u201dFor me personally, I\u2019m planning to stay. I love Yahoo, and I believe in all of you. It\u2019s important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter.\u201d How that will actually play out is unclear.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 When hundreds of thousands of migrants poured into Europe from the Middle East and beyond, Germany stepped in with shelter and aid. Yet a new wave of violence is exposing the extent to which Western Europe\u2019s most populous nation has also opened the door to risk. The latest attack: A rejected Syrian asylum seeker who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and was known by authorities to be suicidal, detonated a backpack bomb rigged with metal projectiles in the Bavarian city of Ansbach late Sunday.",
        "A shooting early Monday morning outside a nightclub in Fort Myers, Fla. killed at least two teenagers and injured more than a dozen other people, with a reported to be among the wounded, according to authorities. At least one person was injured in a shooting about half a mile away that police said was related to the gunfire at the club, which said it was hosting a night for teens. All told, officials said 20 people were injured in the violence early Monday in Fort Myers, a city of about 74, 000 people in southwest Florida.",
        "As she and the rest of the medical team filed into the toddler\u2019s room at the University of Michigan\u2019s C. S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital, Dina Hafez, a resident in internal medicine and pediatrics, feared the worst. The 2\u00bd had been transported overnight from a rural facility because doctors could not figure out why he was getting worse. Unable to walk, the quiet little boy with light brown hair cried when anyone touched his legs, which he held in an odd, froglike position. A rash blanketed his body. His gums were bleeding.",
        "New Zealand is a nation that takes its birds seriously, and it\u2019s got very special ones. The country\u2019s currency is adorned with images of winged species found nowhere else, including the penguin and the kokako. The logo of the national air force is stamped with the famed kiwi \u2014 a puff of feathers that cannot fly. But many of those birds and other native wildlife are under assault from species that showed up with settlers to the island nation 200 years ago.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Prince Harry, whose mother, Princess Diana, died when he was only 12, said he regretted not opening up sooner about how her death had affected him. The British prince, now 31, was speaking at a barbecue he hosted at Kensington Palace in honor of a mental health charity. Guests included some of Britain\u2019s top athletes, who also spoke about their personal struggles. \u201cI really regret not ever talking about it,\u201d the prince told Rio Ferdinand, a former England soccer captain whose wife died from cancer last year.",
        "The immediacy of war is often missing in daily reports and statistics. What about the gnawing hunger from infrequent meals? The sting of dust from unpaved roads? The constant fatigue? The fear of death? These are the details of war Ricardo Garcia Vilanova renders so clearly in his photographs, each story a kaleidoscope of mundanity and swift military action. Originally from Spain, Garcia Vilanova has worked in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, where he was kidnapped and held hostage for six months in 2014.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Hillary Clinton is set to become the first woman to be nominated for president by a major political party on a night that her campaign is hoping will reintroduce her to voters still deeply skeptical of her candidacy. Shortly before 5 p. m. the Democratic Party began its nominating process, with the name of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) put forward by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ( ). She affectionately called Sanders a \u201csomewhat frumpy, and maybe even sometimes grumpy, guy\u201d who created a progressive movement.",
        "As he stood at the lectern Tuesday night, Bill Clinton was doing more than delivering another convention speech, something he has done every four years spanning four decades. This was a larger moment for the former president, and it was a long time coming. In this one speech, he was essentially making good on a marital and political promissory note by employing the full measure of his rhetorical skills to boost his wife\u2019s week as the first woman to become a major party nominee.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 In parks, on trains and outside Philadelphia City Hall, the \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d movement was having its biggest day ever. Some participated in a mock vote to reflect how they wanted the Democratic primary to go. Some slapped the sunflower logo of the Green Party over fading signs for Bernie Sanders. In quieter and more secluded rooms, Sanders \u2014 the unwilling hero of liberals unwilling to support Hillary Clinton for president \u2014 was negotiating the terms of her nomination.",
        "Last week, we found out that Donald Trump\u2019s wife, Melania Trump, is apparently a fan of Michelle Obama\u2019s. In explaining her inadvertent plagiarizing of the first lady\u2019s 2008 convention speech, Melania Trump\u2019s speechwriter said, \u201dA person she has always liked is Michelle Obama.\u201d Is it possible that Melania Trump\u2019s husband agrees with her? As I noted last week, it\u2019s not that unusual for prospective or actual first ladies to say nice things about one another. There is something of a kinship, it seems, and they don\u2019t often get involved in the political sniping.",
        "Imagine if you took all of the kids in student government and asked them what the coolest things about your high school were. The answers would be a mix of kissing up to teachers, appreciation of dorky nonsense and an occasional inadvertently amusing response. So it is when delegates are asked to talk about their home states. Look, these are all political people. They\u2019re all into politics. They\u2019re surrounded by people who care about politics.",
        "Heads have certainly rolled over the DNC email scandal. Party chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had to step down, and acting chair Donna Brazile issued an apology to the Sanders campaign and anybody else who was offended by the emails exchanged between party staffers that were released by Wikileaks. But there\u2019s something utterly bizarre about the kind of coverage this story is getting. Evidence currently suggests that the Russian government may have attempted to sway the results of the U. S. presidential election.",
        "If you\u2019re alive and online, you\u2019ve seen the Dove \u201cReal Beauty\u201d ads, where people react to being called beautiful. They smile, break into tears and hug. These campaigns are meant to make me (and all women) feel good in their own skin. But while I love a good compliment, it doesn\u2019t work on me. I\u2019m ugly, and I know it. In case you think I\u2019m kidding, let me make something perfectly plain: I\u2019m not an idiot, my vision is fine.",
        "Bill Clinton addresses the Democratic convention tonight, and his appearance will present something of a paradox. On the one hand, Bill has provided Donald Trump with a powerful weapon to wield against Hillary Clinton. Trump regularly rails at NAFTA, which passed during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, as proof that both Clintons \u2014 especially Hillary \u2014 belong to a corrupt Beltway elite that for decades has shafted American workers in the industrial Midwest, where Trump hopes to win the election.",
        "George W. Bush left office in January 2009 with an approval rating that hovered in the 20s \u2014 the lowest of any president in modern times. Today, that rating is in the high 40s and low 50s. That is not because the public has changed its mind about the war in Iraq or the domestic excesses of his administration. To the contrary, public opinion is even more negative. The reason for the recovery of Bush\u2019s approval rating is his behavior. As an Bush has been exemplary. He has avoided the limelight and stayed out of the political arena.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Even as President Obama prepares to speak on her behalf at the convention here and to campaign for her this fall, a big element of Hillary Clinton\u2019s electoral case hinges on the implicit argument that she can somehow succeed where Obama failed: overcoming partisanship and dislodging Washington gridlock. This tricky path is made all the more complicated because some of the very folks making that pitch on Clinton\u2019s behalf are Obama administration veterans who witnessed the president fail \u2014 he has admitted as much \u2014 at his proclaimed task of bringing together red and blue America.",
        "Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality. The word \u201closer\u201d is spoken with such contempt these days, a man might like to forget the losses in his own life that taught him something about good judgment.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 The Islamic State\u2019s war on Europe seems to have entered a dangerous new phase, evolving from highly coordinated operations on the grand boulevards of Paris and Brussels to amateur assaults in the hinterlands that have suddenly turned anyone, anywhere into a target. The nature of the attacks in Europe over the past two weeks is confounding European intelligence agencies, at times turning terrorism response into a ground war fought by already stretched local police.",
        "Michelle Obama\u2019s speech during the first day of the Democratic National Convention was generally lauded. One sentence in particular garnered more attention, and controversy, than the rest: That is the story of this country, the story that has brought me to this stage tonight, the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.",
        "Within hours of their performance at a Donald Trump rally in Pensacola, Fla. last January, the U. S. A. Freedom Kids were a sensation. You remember the video: Three preteen girls in outfits crisply working through simple choreography as they an upbeat update to \u201dOver There.\u201d That infectious performance kicked off a flurry of media appearances. The Freedom Kids told \u201dInside Edition\u201d that Trump told them that he planned to listen to their CD all night. The group, which had been around for about 2\u00bd years by that point, was a viral sensation largely inextricable from Trump himself.",
        "The unemployment rate is not a conspiracy. It is not manipulated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And anyone who suggests otherwise is either uninformed, or trying to misinform others. Which is to say that you shouldn\u2019t listen to Donald Trump & Co. For a year now, the alleged billionaire has insisted that the \u201dreal\u201d unemployment rate is something like 42 percent instead of the 4. 9 percent it actually is. He hasn\u2019t said how he\u2019s gotten this \u2014 maybe it\u2019s from the same \u201dextremely credible source\u201d who told him President Obama\u2019s birth certificate was fake?"
