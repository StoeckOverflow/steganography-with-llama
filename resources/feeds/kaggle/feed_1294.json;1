        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkish leaders on Tuesday stepped up their calls for the United States to punish Fethullah Gulen, the reclusive cleric living in Pennsylvania whose organization is said to be behind the failed July 15 coup attempt that sought to topple President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government. Officials in Ankara insist that Gulen had a direct hand in the coup plot, a mutiny led by a faction in the military that led to about 290 deaths before it was quashed. U. S. Secretary of State John F.",
        "A grand jury indicted two former Virginia Tech students on murder and other charges Tuesday in the killing of Blacksburg resident Nicole Lovell, a prosecutor said. The Montgomery County, Va. grand jury returned the indictments against David Eisenhauer of Columbia, Md. and Natalie Keepers of Laurel, Md. both 19, after hearing a little more than an hour of testimony about the January slaying. Authorities allege that Eisenhauer and Keepers hatched a plan to kill Lovell and that Eisenhauer lured Lovell from her Blacksburg home on a cold January night and stabbed her in a wooded area.",

        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 In an election season in which restive voters of all stripes are frustrated with the status quo, it fell to President Obama on Wednesday to argue for staying the course by giving Democrats a third term in the White House \u2014 and that Hillary Clinton is the right person to keep moving the nation forward. Having spent the first two nights of the Democratic National Convention trying to unify the party behind Clinton, a procession of leading party figures made a sharp pivot to GOP nominee Donald Trump.",
        "PHILADELPHIA  \u201d Republican nominee Donald Trump pleaded directly Wednesday with the Russian government to meddle in the U. S. presidential election by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton  \u201d an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented maneuver in American politics.",

        "Donald Trump just walked into another political and foreign policy minefield of his own making. Trump said Wednesday that he hopes a country that just happens to be one of the United States\u2019 most antagonistic fellow world powers \u2014 Russia \u2014 has or would obtain unreleased emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state. \u201dThey probably have her 33, 000 emails, too. I hope they do,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201dRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing.",
        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump \u2014 I can\u2019t believe I wrote those words \u2014 gave a news conference today. Shall we first count the outrages or the lies? I think we need to start at the top of the outrage column. Asked about the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails, which many experts believe was carried out by agents of the Russian government, Trump speculated that Russia might also have hacked into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. Then he asked the Russians to release any deleted emails they might have found there.",
        "The Republicans have a big problem \u2014 one entirely of their own making. Donald Trump in a news conference this morning gave the Hillary Clinton camp more ammunition than Democrats could possibly hope for in their effort to show Trump unfit for the presidency. His invitation to Vladimir Putin to help him in the election was as as anything he said in this election. He told reporters, \u201cRussia, if you are listening, I hope you are able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by the press.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s latest outburst, in which he openly called on Russia to go on a massive cyberhunt for Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and release them to the press, raises a key question: What will it take for leading Republicans to cross over from responding to Trump\u2019s remarks in a careful, circumscribed manner, or quietly withholding their support for him, to actively denouncing his comments as reckless and dangerous?",
        "Once upon a time, a boy from Arkansas spotted a girl from Illinois across a crowded classroom. And on Tuesday night in Philadelphia, on the night Hillary Rodham Clinton became their party\u2019s official nominee for president, Bill Clinton did his best to make one of the marriages in the history of American politics fit into the contours of a fairy tale.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 On Monday night in a widely praised speech here at the Democratic National Convention, first lady Michelle Obama made a poignant observation about her life and race in America: \u201cI wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters \u2014 two beautiful, intelligent, black young women \u2014 playing with their dogs on the White House lawn. \u201d Within minutes, PolitiFact confirmed the factual rigor of Obama\u2019s claim. The New York Times also did a : \u201cYes, Slaves Did Help Build the White House.",
        "Russia was behind the hacks into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer network that led to the release of thousands of internal emails just before the party\u2019s convention began, U. S. intelligence agencies have reportedly concluded. The FBI is investigating. WikiLeaks promises there is more data to come. The political nature of this cyberattack means that Democrats and Republicans are trying to spin this as much as possible. Even so, we have to accept that someone is attacking our nation\u2019s computer systems in an apparent attempt to influence a presidential election.",
        "PARIS \u2014 The Islamic attack on a quiet village church in northern France on Tuesday was relatively small: one dead and one other injured. But its significance was anything but. In a country where the village church remains a national symbol, many here see the attack as an exacerbation of a culture war over religion in a nominally secular but increasingly divided society.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey\u2019s government has ordered the closure of dozens of media outlets \u2014 including news agencies, television channels, radio stations and newspapers \u2014 as part of its widespread crackdown in the wake of a failed coup attempt on July 15. Authorities have suspended thousands of people working in the country\u2019s judicial, education, health and financial sectors. But the move against media outlets escalated a campaign against journalists in a country that had once been hailed as a model of democracy in the region.",
        "Even as President Obama prepares to pass the torch to Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, he and Michelle Obama have finalized one aspect of their House life: the future Obama presidential library site. The couple, according to a person familiar with the decision who asked for anonymity because it is not yet public, has selected Jackson Park on Chicago\u2019s South Side. University of Chicago officials had suggested either Jackson Park or Washington Park, both of which are historic areas designed by Frederick Law Olmstead and Calvert Vaux.",
        "When President Ronald Reagan \u2014 my father \u2014 was lying in a hospital bed recovering from the gunshots that nearly killed him, he said, \u201cI know my ability to heal depends on my willingness to forgive John Hinckley. \u201d I, too, believe in forgiveness. But forgiving someone in your heart doesn\u2019t mean that you let them loose in Virginia to pursue whatever dark agenda they may still hold dear. I have no choice but to resign myself to the fact of Hinckley\u2019s release, announced earlier today, but I\u2019m not at all comfortable with the decision.",
        "Scientists have discovered a bacterium living inside the human nose that produces an antibiotic capable of killing one of the most pathogens \u2014 a pathogen that causes serious, even deadly skin and wound infections, bloodstream infections and pneumonia. German researchers found that this antibacterial substance was effective in treating skin infections in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, according to a study published Wednesday in Nature.

        "Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby\u2019s promises of justice nearly 15 months ago calmed a violent, broken city, bringing her instant national celebrity \u2014 even a Vogue magazine spread with photos by Annie Leibovitz \u2014 and talk of a sky\u2019 political future. She and her husband, City Council member Nick Mosby (D) reigned as Baltimore\u2019s rising stars. At the same time, the prosecutor\u2019s many detractors, especially in the law enforcement community, labeled her the rankest kind of opportunist. They accused her of recklessly slapping together criminal cases with unseemly haste in an rush to judgment.",

        "In 1997, Joshua Harris published \u201cI Kissed Dating Goodbye,\u201d a book that was in part a warning about the harm that relationships before marriage could cause. Harris evoked images of men at the altar bringing all their past partners with them into the marriage to reinforce the point that love and sex before marriage took pieces of your heart and made you less. At the time, Harris was just 21, but he was already a rising star.",
        "A lot of people deny climate change. Not many, though, deny gravity. That\u2019s why a recent animation released by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory \u2014 well, it came out in April, but people seem to be noticing it now \u2014 is so striking. Because it suggests the likely gravitational imprint of our changing climate on key features of the Earth in a way that\u2019s truly startling.",

        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Hillary Clinton formally accepted the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president Thursday night, delivering a speech in which she said that the nation is in a \u201cmoment of reckoning\u201d and aggressively cast Republican nominee Donald Trump as a divisive figure stoking fear across the country. \u201cHe wants to divide us from the rest of the world, and from each other,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe\u2019s betting that the perils of today\u2019s world will blind us to its unlimited promise.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Democrats presented a symbolically powerful national security argument for presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as their party convention closed Thursday, amounting to a rebuttal of complaints by Republicans that the party was not focused enough on vital matters of war and terrorism. \u201cWe trust her judgment. We believe in her vision for a united America and we believe in her vision of America as the just and strong leader against the forces of hatred, chaos and darkness,\u201d retired Marine Gen. John R. Allen thundered.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Every night here at the Democratic National Convention, the video clips have appeared on the giant screens above the arena floor. \u201cPutting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a deportation force. \u201d \u201cA total and complete shutdown of Muslims in the United States. \u201d On their biggest stage yet, Democrats have brandished what they believe is their most powerful weapon against Donald Trump: His own words.",
        "The device is as old as Shakespeare, as dramatically durable and seductive as the part of the Porter in \u201cMacbeth\u201d or the gravediggers in \u201cHamlet\u201d: putting eloquence, at a climactic moment, in the mouth of the common man. Or, in the case of the Democratic National Convention, the ordinary woman. It happened with consummate theatricality Wednesday night, when the role of introducing the president of the United States went not to a dignitary, or even a family member, but to a \u201csweet little old lady\u201d from Perrysburg Township, Ohio.",
        "Donald Trump says many controversial things. And as the political world reacts accordingly, his defense of those comments is often liable to change. And like clockwork, such is the case with his comments calling on Russia to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. A day after making the comments and defending them, Trump has a novel explanation for all of it: I was joking! Here\u2019s his exchange with \u201dFox and Friends\u201d from Thursday morning: BRIAN KILMEADE: Clinton campaign says this is a national security issue.",
        "This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Hillary Clinton ALSO used the phrase last month. The Donald Trump campaign is still apparently sore about being caught plagiarizing last week. And now they have a great retort \u2014 better even than that \u201dMy Little Pony\u201d defense: I\u2019m honored that POTUS would plagiarize a line from my speech last week.

        "The United States\u2019 first black president spent a fair bit of time talking about the other side of his family tree during his speech Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention, recalling his grandparents and their predecessors in some detail: See, my grandparents they came from the heartland. Their ancestors began settling there about 200 years ago. I don\u2019t know if they had their birth certificates, but they were there. They were mostly farmers, teachers, ranch hands, pharmacists, oil rig workers. Hearty, folks."
