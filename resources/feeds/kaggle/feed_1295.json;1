        "THE MORNING PLUM: If there was one single overarching goal in President Obama\u2019s remarkable speech to the nation last night, it was this: To cast not just Donald Trump, but Trumpism writ large, as a unique and even existential threat to the American experiment itself. This was a lofty philosophical project, and it was widely seen as such in the commentary that greeted the speech immediately after it concluded.",
        "Last month, The Post reported: CrowdStrike had installed software on the [Democratic National Committee\u2019s] computers so that it could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access, when and how. The firm identified two separate hacker groups, both working for the Russian government, that had infiltrated the network, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike and chief technology officer. The firm had analyzed other breaches by both groups over the past two years. One group, which CrowdStrike had dubbed Cozy Bear, had gained access last summer and was monitoring the DNC\u2019s email and chat communications, Alperovitch said.",
        "Throughout 2016, The Washington Post editorial board has pleaded with Republican leaders: \u201cAre you really going to let this happen to your party?\u201d The \u201cthis,\u201d of course, is Donald Trump. In a live panel discussion at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, Editorial page editor Fred Hiatt expanded on why the editorial board decided to publish a Sunday editorial ruling out an endorsement of Trump for president, an unprecedented move this early in an election year.",
        "In his brilliant speech Wednesday night, President Obama not only laid claim to a vision of the nation\u2019s future that is different from what Donald Trump offers. He also sought to reclaim a vision of the nation\u2019s past. Until now, Democrats have mostly responded in two ways to Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cMake America Great Again. \u201d They have insisted that the nation is already great and that voters should reject a candidate who would \u201ctrash talk\u201d the United States, as Hillary Clinton put it over the weekend.",
        "When Chelsea Clinton takes the stage on Thursday night to introduce her mother, she faces a tall order. The once and perhaps future first daughter will be in direct competition with longtime friend Ivanka Trump, who emerged as the star of last week\u2019s Republican convention. Even Democrats were impressed by the performance of the glamorous and businesswoman often referred to as \u201cTrump\u2019s better half. \u201d Tweeted Mia Farrow, \u201cWhen is Ivanka running for President?\u201d No matter what she says, Ms.",
        "Babs Proller met the man when she was living in a Maryland hotel. He had helped the local actress carry her dog, Buddy, to her room, and over the course of several days in early July, the two neighbors became friendly. She soon learned that her new acquaintance, Armando Morales, was a convicted felon and former gang member, recently released after decades in prison. He was also the star witness in one of the Washington area\u2019s most sensational murder trials. Proller eventually became suspicious of Morales and began recording hours of their conversations.",
        "After a professional life spent speaking before TV cameras, former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson isn\u2019t often at a loss for words. But when I asked her how she felt as she watched Roger Ailes \u2014 perhaps the most powerful media figure in America \u2014 step down as Fox News chief only two weeks after she had sued him for sexual harassment, she searched for the right description. \u201cAt first, satisfaction \u2014 or no, I think validation,\u201d she told me Wednesday.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Deep into Wells Fargo Arena, past the racially diverse hordes from Democratic strongholds and swing states that get prime spots on the convention floor, sat Donna Pence, retired schoolteacher from Idaho. Pence, 74, a state legislator wearing a \u201cFeminists for Hillary\u201d button, was once a supporter of conservative hero Barry Goldwater. But on Wednesday night, Pence was cheering for a different Barry, a president she has grown to admire. For vast swaths of the country, President Obama might be the most familiar black man in people\u2019s lives.",
        "Jose DelReal is one of a small team of people who cover Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for The Washington Post. On Wednesday, he was in Milwaukee to cover an appearance by Trump running mate Mike Pence. DelReal was barred from covering the event as a reporter, in keeping with Trump\u2019s ban on The Washington Post. DelReal then tried to enter the event as a citizen. He was told he could not enter with a cell phone despite the fact that other people were not held to that same standard.",
        "In a tweet, the North Carolina Republican Party called out Democratic nominee Tim Kaine for wearing the flag of Honduras on his lapel during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday. Except it wasn\u2019t the flag of the small Latin American country where Kaine had spent a year doing missionary work, but instead the pin was a mini Service Flag, or blue star flag, denoting his son\u2019s current service in the United States Marine Corps. Here\u2019s a screenshot of that @NCGOP tweet about @timkaine, since they deleted it. #DemsInPhilly pic. twitter.",
        "James Alan McPherson, an author of widely anthologized short stories and essays that both explored and transcended black experiences in America, and who in 1978 became the first black author to receive the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, died July 27 at a hospice center in Iowa City. He was 72. The cause was complications from pneumonia, said his daughter, Rachel McPherson. Mr. McPherson\u2019s life took him from segregated Georgia, where he grew up in poverty as the son of an alcoholic father, to Harvard Law School during the social upheaval of the 1960s.",
        "NBC\u2019s Olympics broadcasting team will be short one of the industry\u2019s most colorful personalities (and some of the most colorful jackets) as news broke Thursday that veteran sideline reporter Craig Sager would no longer be traveling to Rio. The returned to the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas to seek additional treatments for leukemia, the network announced. \u201cHe is preparing for a third bone marrow transplant which will prevent him from covering the Olympics in Rio,\u201d the network said in a press release. \u201cWe wish him the best in his continued recovery.",
        "For many Americans, Vladimir Putin is perceived as some kind of international boogeyman, with alleged links to nefarious plots all over the world. This perception helps explain why many Americans find Donald Trump\u2019s seemingly admiring comments about the Russian president so unnerving. Yet Trump seems unmoved by critics of this rhetoric. On Wednesday, after widespread speculation that hackers had helped release a series of embarrassing emails from the Democratic National Committee, the Republican presidential nominee appeared to push further than ever before, appearing to appeal for Russian leadership to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s email.",
        "Earlier this week, Redditors were given a pretty neat opportunity: Two leaders from the Maasai tribe, a seminomadic people living in Western Kenya, signed on to do an \u201cAsk Me Anything. \u201d Redditors asked about the standard stuff: religious practices, diet, what people in the village do for fun. And then, inevitably, one user asked the chiefs to describe their favorite \u201ckind of Internet porn. \u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t believe it and don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d the chiefs\u2019 interlocutor replied \u2014 to a giddily gleeful audience. \u201cDon\u2019t think or know about pornography.",
        "(Michael Washington Post) Last week, Republicans converged on Cleveland to coronate their presidential candidate. While it was definitely an eventful week, the violence that people had predicted never came to fruition and it was a more or less peaceful affair. This week, Democrats descended on Philadelphia for the very same purpose.",
        "The Clinton presidential campaign said Friday that an \u201canalytics data program\u201d maintained by the Democratic National Committee had been hacked but that its computer system had not been compromised, denying news reports from earlier in the day that the campaign had become the third Democratic Party organization whose systems had been penetrated. So far, campaign computer experts \u201chave found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised,\u201d campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Hillary Clinton kicked off a bus tour on Friday with a rally here in the same city where she accepted the Democratic party\u2019s presidential nomination Thursday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great convention but now we\u2019ve got to go out and fight for our vision of America,\u201d Clinton told the crowd at Temple University. Clinton, the first woman to be a presidential nominee, was joined by her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (Va. ). Clinton said that, after her excitement from the night wore off, she was struck by the seriousness of the campaign ahead of her.",
        "PITTSBURGH \u2014 When Bill Clinton and Al Gore hopped off a campaign bus loaded with reporters in this steel city after the 1992 Democratic National Convention, they electrified supporters at a time when presidential bus tours and a Clinton aiming for the White House were new. On Saturday, when Hillary Clinton arrives by bus here with Tim Kaine, she is hoping to that excitement in a different way. Democrats are counting on her to generate her own buzz as the first woman to lead a ticket.",
        "One of the more effective speeches during the Democratic convention came from former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. In many ways, Bloomberg is what Donald Trump wants to be: a very rich guy who runs a media company and who converted that wealth into political power. Of all of the rich New Yorkers involved in the 2016 campaign, Bloomberg is the richest, worth some $40 billion, four times what Trump says he\u2019s worth and 13 times what Bloomberg (the media company) estimates Trump is actually worth.",
        "Republican nominee Mike Pence appeared on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show Friday morning to cry foul over President Obama alluding to Donald Trump as a \u201dhomegrown demagogue.\u201d \u201dI don\u2019t think has any place in public life,\u201d Pence said, according to a transcript from Hewitt\u2019s show. \u201dAnd I thought that was unfortunate that the president of the United States would use a term like that.\u201d At almost exactly the same time as the Pence transcript was being sent out to reporters, here\u2019s what Trump was tweeting: Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech.",
        "CITY | This is the second of a continuing series that will examine issues related to repeat violent offenders in the District of Columbia. Read the previous story in this series. COLEMAN, Fla. \u2014 Within a cellblock reserved for problem inmates at the nation\u2019s largest federal prison complex, Antwon Pitt became known as a sexual menace. The violent offender from D. C. now 22, habitually dropped his pants, exposed his penis and masturbated when anyone passed by his cell, according to detailed accounts from 10 prison staffers. A male corrections officer said Pitt exposed himself and demanded oral sex.",
        "A federal appeals court on Friday struck down North Carolina\u2019s requirement that voters show identification before casting ballots and reinstated an additional week of early voting. The decision by a panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit was an overwhelming victory for civil rights groups and the Justice Department that argued the voting law was designed to dampen the growing political clout of African American voters, who participated in record numbers in elections in 2008 and 2012.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention week featured two of the most effective communicators in the Democratic Party offering different images of the nominee. In Bill Clinton\u2019s version, she is a \u201cchange maker\u201d who has \u201cnever been satisfied with the status quo. \u201d In Barack Obama\u2019s telling, she has the \u201cintelligence\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d to carry forward his administration\u2019s ideals into a third term, because the status quo is pretty darn good. When the spotlight finally came, the nominee was very much herself \u2014 a tenacious plodder, advocating liberalism. This is closer to Obama\u2019s description than her husband\u2019s.",
        "Midway through Hillary Clinton\u2019s discursive speech at this week\u2019s Democratic National Convention, she gave a brief insight into her prospective strengths as a president \u2014 and her manifest weakness as a candidate. \u201cThe truth is, through all these years of public service, the \u2018service\u2019 part has always come easier to me than the \u2018public\u2019 part,\u201d she said. \u201cI get it that some people just don\u2019t know what to make of me. \u201d And how could they? Her on the national stage has proved her to be capable and dedicated.",
        "The bad news is that Donald Trump is almost destroying the Republican Party. As Hillary Clinton said, \u201cHe\u2019s taken the Republican Party a long way from \u2018Morning in America\u2019 to \u2018midnight in America. \u2019\u201d She might have added that he has taken the GOP from the party of William F. Buckley Jr. to the party of from Abraham Lincoln to bigots and from Cold Warriors to Vladimir Putin\u2019s poodles. The good news is that he\u2019s helping the Democratic Party improve considerably.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: In becoming the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major party, Hillary Clinton last night moved in a liberal direction by reaffirming the Democratic Party\u2019s commitment to diversifying America while also outlining an economically progressive agenda. Meanwhile, she made a real pitch to expand the party\u2019s appeal to the center with genuine outreach to voter groups. The big story of the Democratic convention is that those two things were not in contradiction.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The final night of the Democratic convention had a different feel from the first three nights: a tangible excitement among the attendees about being present for the first acceptance speech for a nomination delivered by a woman. Hillary Clinton\u2019s address did not outshine the occasion; how could it? Acceptance speeches rarely dazzle rhetorically. But Clinton\u2019s speech got the job done. It was \u2014 and I mean this as a compliment \u2014 a competent speech, with the surprisingly controversial argument that a president needs to be competent.",
        "Six Michigan employees were charged Friday with misconduct in office for their alleged roles in the lead contamination of Flint\u2019s water supply, which has exposed thousands of children to the toxin and left most city residents drinking bottled water for more than two years. Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) filed the charges against three employees of the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services and three others from the state Department of Environmental Quality, including the former chief of Michigan\u2019s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance.",
        "Florida officials on Friday announced the first local spread of the Zika virus through infected mosquitoes in the continental United States. Gov. Rick Scott made the announcement during a press conference Friday after a health department investigation into four suspected cases in and Broward counties. He said transmission was confined to a small neighborhood just north of Miami. \u201cWe learned today that four people in our state likely have the Zika virus as a result of a mosquito bite,\u201d he said.",
        "Russian government hackers have breached the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to individuals familiar with the matter. The intrusion appeared to be carried out by the same Russian intelligence service that hacked the Democratic National Committee earlier this year, the individuals said. The attack indicates that the Russians are targeting multiple institutions at the heart of American politics, escalating concerns about a foreign government meddling in this country\u2019s democratic process. The FBI is treating the DNC and DCCC breaches as one investigation now, said one person briefed on the matter."
