The social network said this week that it faces a potential $5 billion tax bill after moving some of its assets to Ireland.

As president, he has said he would move fast to destroy the Islamic State, scrap bad trade deals, build that wall, \u201cstop the gangs and the violence,\u201d and \u201cstop the drugs from pouring into our communities. \u201d He would \u201cimmediately suspend immigration\u201d from countries where terrorism is rampant.

        "I worry that all of my children will have problems dealing with the police, but for different reasons. Damien, 11, is the darkest and most clearly of my children. His first response when given any order is to question, not comply, and most cops I\u2019ve seen don\u2019t take that too kindly. Antonio, whose skin tone looks more like my dark bronze hue, has at the tender age of 5 convinced himself, and everyone he gets a chance to ramble on to, that he will be a police officer as soon as he turns 21.",
