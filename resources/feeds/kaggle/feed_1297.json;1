        "ELLICOTT CITY, MD. \u2014 She realized something was wrong Saturday night when the creaking sound outside her Main Street apartment grew louder. Kelly Secret did not know it yet, but she and her boyfriend were trapped. On one side of their building, a creek had flooded, and on the other, a torrent of raging, brown water was devouring Ellicott City\u2019s historic downtown. \u201cThe whole house shook,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought we were gone.",
        "KASHIWA, JAPAN \u2014 In the United States, there\u2019s no end to stories and listicles and books telling you how to work more productively so you can spend more time with your family or doing the things you love. In Japan, there\u2019s not even a term for \u201c balance. \u201d What there is, though, is a word for \u201cdeath by overwork. \u201d It\u2019s \u201ckaroshi,\u201d and it\u2019s considered such an inevitable result of Japan\u2019s notoriously grueling work culture that it\u2019s hardly even discussed. But every year here, hundreds, maybe thousands, of Japanese people literally work themselves to death.",

He said he would like to hear from me. Here is my answer to Donald Trump: Because without saying a thing, all the world, all America, felt my pain. I am a Gold Star mother. Whoever saw me felt me in their heart. Donald Trump said I had nothing to say. I do. My son Humayun Khan, an Army captain, died 12 years ago in Iraq.",
        "The dire results of President Obama\u2019s experiment in downsizing U. S. leadership are obvious overseas, but there\u2019s a damaging consequence at home that gets less attention: The mistake builds on itself. It is the opposite of . As the United States withdraws from the world, in other words, the world grows messier and uglier \u2014 and that only confirms for many Americans that any involvement is foolish and futile. This feedback loop fuels the kind of isolationism we\u2019ve seen this year from Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.",
        "Republican politicians face a choice. They can accept Hillary Clinton\u2019s invitation to abandon Donald Trump and prevent a redefinition of their party as a haven for bigotry. Or they can prop Trump up, try to maximize his vote \u2014 and thereby tarnish themselves for a generation. If there were any doubts about Trump\u2019s disqualifying lack of simple decency and empathy, he resolved them on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d over the weekend with a characteristically cruel and attack on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, an American Muslim couple whose son, Army Capt.",

        "The hostility toward Wall Street remains so great that both political parties say, in their platforms, that they\u2019d like to break up America\u2019s biggest banks. But before engaging in this drastic economic surgery, it\u2019s worth examining whether is working. Recall that the law, named after its congressional sponsors, former senator Christopher J. Dodd ( .) and former representative Barney Frank ( .) overhauled the financial system to make it more panic proof. Is it? The answer may surprise.",
        "ON JULY 1, the Agriculture Department was supposed to announce the results of a pilot program that could help the poorest Americans eat healthier, The Post\u2019s Rachel Premack reported. The only problem? The program had not even begun. Instead, the initiative to accept food stamps in some online grocery services will launch in the fall. If all goes well, the department should implement it nationwide. Online grocery delivery services are becoming more popular among Americans who want to skip the hassle of trekking to a supermarket.",
        "On July 12, the high in Phoenix was 110 degrees, according to Weather Underground. That\u2019s not quite hot enough to effectively fry an egg on the street, according to The Washington Post, but it is hot enough to severely burn the bottom of someone\u2019s feet. Police said that\u2019s exactly what happened when Mark Simmons decided to punish his son by \u201ctaking the boy outside and making him stand barefoot on the ground in the backyard as punishment,\u201d according to court records cited by ABC affiliate .",
        "Baylor University is in the midst of a scandal over sexual assaults that has cost the school its president and its football coach, Art Briles, who lifted the program to national prominence. While an outside investigation concluded that Baylor\u2019s athletic department acted with indifference, if not outright hostility, toward female students who attempted to report rapes, another aspect of the school\u2019s culture may have been preventing other women from telling their stories: its strict code of conduct. Baylor\u2019s rules for its students stem from its conservative Christian roots; it banned dancing on campus until 1996.",
        "Hillary Clinton is heading to heavily Republican Nebraska on Monday in search of a single electoral vote. In a move that suggests the Democratic presidential nominee is taking nothing for granted against Republican Donald Trump, Clinton has scheduled a late afternoon rally in Omaha, a moderate pocket of an otherwise conservative state. Here\u2019s why: Nebraska is one of only two states that awards part of its electoral votes based on outcomes in congressional districts. The other is Maine. In Nebraska\u2019s case, two of the state\u2019s five electoral votes go to the statewide winner.",

I don\u2019t know why those particular dates \u2026 you know, Hillary Clinton wants to be against the NFL.

        "As the newly nominated presidential candidates plunge into the last 100 days of the campaign, news organizations might pause before they do the same. We should think of what the disembodied voice on a GPS repeats \u2014 \u201crecalculating\u201d \u2014 when it\u2019s time to make a course correction. How should the media recalculate in the months before Nov. 8, especially given the sharp divisions in the country?

        "In the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008, amid the destruction of businesses, lives and trust, many clamored for accountability. People wanted trials, convictions, the closing of tax loopholes and a broad repudiation of bankers\u2019 being above the law. Nearly a decade after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the financial crisis unraveled, those calls have largely gone unanswered, including in the United States. But on Friday, a court in Dublin convicted three bankers of crimes related to their roles in the global market meltdown.",

But consider this our dark mark in the sky: If you\u2019re looking to read about \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d without any spoilers, read this instead.

        "RICHMOND \u2014 At his national introduction as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, Sen.

        "A bipartisan constellation of decorated combat veterans, members of Congress and family members of slain soldiers admonished Donald Trump on Monday for criticizing the Muslim American parents of an Army officer killed in Iraq, threatening to undermine Trump\u2019s support among core Republican voters.

        "Robert Kagan is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a contributing columnist for The Post. One wonders if Republican leaders have begun to realize that they may have hitched their fate and the fate of their party to a man with a disordered personality. We can leave it to the professionals to determine exactly what to call it. Suffice to say that Donald Trump\u2019s response to the assorted speakers at the Democratic National Convention has not been rational. Why denigrate the parents of a soldier who died serving his country in Iraq?",

It\u2019s this: If individual Republicans don\u2019t break off their support for Trump\u2019s candidacy now \u2014 by, say, withdrawing their endorsements \u2014 they run the risk of having no choice but to do so after Trump sinks even further into wretchedness and depravity, to a point of true no return."
