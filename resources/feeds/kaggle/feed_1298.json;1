        "years ago, America faced the challenge of a snarling demagogue, who captured the imagination of millions by fusing legitimate fears of an external enemy with the cultural, regional and demographic resentments of people who disliked the changing nature of our postwar country. Then, as now, a demagogue could draw upon widespread weariness with imperfect and occasionally complacent liberal leaders, important or petty security scandals, the grind of military stalemate in an inconclusive long war.",
        "Vanita Gupta is head of the Civil Rights Division at the U. S. Department of Justice. \u201cNow we can go with the full bill. \u201d That was a North Carolina legislator\u2019s promise, just hours after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision invalidating powerful protections against discriminatory voting rules. Out went the modest proposal. In came a bill designed to shrink the electorate. The legislature passed a law targeting specific practices \u2014 including registration and early voting \u2014 that had helped drive recent surges in minority voter turnout.",
        "For the first time, the Zika virus has prompted public health officials to warn pregnant women to avoid traveling to a part of the continental United States. The travel advisory comes in response to a growing outbreak of the disease in South Florida. The state on Monday said there are 10 more people who have been infected with the Zika virus who likely contracted it from local mosquitoes, bringing the total number of such cases in the state to 14. All of the cases have surfaced in a densely populated community north of downtown Miami.",
        "President Obama will use a visit from the prime minister of Singapore on Tuesday to launch a final public campaign for a landmark Asia Pacific trade accord, but proponents are losing hope that deal can survive the strong, rancor among fellow Democrats. Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton forcefully reiterated her opposition to the Partnership at the Democratic National Convention last week, a move intended to quell unrest among party liberals but an outcome that White House allies saw as a setback for the administration.",

S. school districts indicated Monday that they think the Satanic Temple\u2019s plan to open \u201cAfter School Satan\u201d clubs in elementary schools probably conforms with their policies and local laws, and the Prince George\u2019s County, Md. school system said it is reviewing a request to open such a club. If the districts allow the clubs, it would pave the way for the Temple to create a counterpoint to evangelical Christian clubs in schools nationwide.",

        "Hillary Clinton said it herself. The \u201cpublic\u201d part of public service has never been easy. Now, with the Democratic nomination in hand, it\u2019s time to meet America. And please, advisors, that doesn\u2019t mean popping up on \u201cCarpool Karaoke. \u201d It\u2019s time to go on Stern.

Together we\u2019ve covered multiple countries, cared for a cat and two dogs and produced a beautiful baby boy. So why did it take me years to address us in the plural because I felt allergic to the word \u201cwe\u201d? Why did he have to practically blackmail me before I would put his name on the voice mail?",

        "When photographer Kevin Horan moved into a house on quaint Whidbey Island in Washington state, along with it came a small herd of woolly neighbors. Whenever he came or went, he was greeted enthusiastically by a chorus of bleats. \u201cSoprano, bass, raspy, soft, quick, slow: they were all different. It occurred to me these creatures were all individuals,\u201d Horan said via email. So naturally Horan says he asked if he could make their portraits. \u201cSure, knock yourself out,\u201d the neighbor replied.

Ryan in his upcoming primary election, saying in an interview Tuesday that he is \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d in endorsing his party\u2019s elected official. Trump also said he was not supporting Sen. John McCain in his primary in Arizona, and he singled out Sen. Kelly Ayotte as a weak and disloyal leader in New Hampshire, a state whose presidential primary Trump won handily.

Trump pointed to several court cases nationwide in which restrictive laws requiring voters to show identification have been thrown out. He said those decisions open the door to fraud in November. \u201cIf the election is rigged, I would not be surprised,\u201d he told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday afternoon. \u201cThe voter ID situation has turned out to be a very unfair development.",

        "Every woman in Congress has a story about being ignored by men. For Sen. Susan Collins ( ) that story is about Donald H. Rumsfeld. It was May 7, 2004, nine days after CBS News aired photos of U. S. soldiers mistreating naked and bloodied Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. On Capitol Hill, where Secretary Rumsfeld was called to answer for the misconduct, Collins asked in a hearing whether he regretted not disclosing and condemning the crimes upfront.

The Republican presidential nominee, rallying supporters in a high school auditorium here, was talking about Chinese currency manipulation when an infant began to cry. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that baby. I love babies,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The mom\u2019s running around like \u2014 don\u2019t worry about it, you know.

        "President Obama tore into Donald Trump today, flatly declaring him \u201cunfit\u201d for the presidency and calling on Republican elected officials to withdraw their support for him. Here\u2019s what he said: \u201cThe Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president. I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it \u2026 the notion that he would attack a Gold Star family, the fact that he doesn\u2019t appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues \u2014 in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia \u2014 means that he\u2019s woefully unprepared \u2026 .",

(The math checks out.) In July, 2012, Mitt Romney raised $28. 6 million in individual contributions \u2014 not all of them small donors. Hillary Clinton, for her part, reported raising $63 million last month, with more than half of the contributions coming from new donors and an average donation of $44.",

Sure, players were getting in trouble \u2014 for trespassing and taking out the game at inappropriate times. But Niantic, the developer behind the franchise was sitting fairly pretty. Now, less than a month after the game\u2019s launch, it\u2019s probably safe to call the honeymoon over. Since its launch, the game has lost some popularity \u2014 it actually has fallen to No. 2 in the Japanese version of Apple\u2019s App Store, according to the app tracking firm App Annie."
