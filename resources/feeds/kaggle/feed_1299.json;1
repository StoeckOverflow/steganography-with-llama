        "An avid reader glances casually at the cover of a novel called Carousel Court. ? Oh, Joe McGinniss has a new book? ? Well, yes. And no. The author is actually Joe McGinniss Jr. not his late father. This is his second novel, which means another round of talking about the blessing and the curse of his famous, exhausting, alcoholic parent. When he was growing up, their relationship was pretty much wonderful when I was around him, ? says Joe Jr. 45, sitting in the office of his home in Northwest Washington. His career was off the charts.",
        "This month, the National Park Service marks its 100th anniversary. One of Wonkblog\u2019s favorite data scientists, a guy named Randal Olson who\u2019s a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, decided to mark the occasion by creating a map of the shortest possible road trip through all 47 national parks in the continental United States. The trip spans just a hair under 14, 500 miles, from Acadia National Park in Maine to Redwood National and State Parks in California. Olson estimates it would take about two months to run the circuit, depending on your tolerance for long driving days.",
        "The Republican Party was in turmoil again Wednesday as party leaders, strategists and donors voiced increasing alarm about the flailing state of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy and fears that the presidential nominee was damaging the party with an extraordinary week of mistakes, gratuitous attacks and missed opportunities. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was described as \u201cvery frustrated\u201d and stressed by Trump\u2019s behavior over the past week, having run out of excuses to make on the nominee\u2019s behalf with donors and other party leaders, according to multiple people familiar with the events.",
        "GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump was buoyed an enthusiastic base of small donors in July, helping him raise $82 million in conjunction with the Republican National Committee, the campaign announced Wednesday. Of that, $64 million came in the form of donations contributed online and through direct mail solicitations, the campaign said. Another $16 million was raised through 20 pricey fundraising events held in conjunction with the RNC. In addition, Trump personally contributed $2 million to his campaign, for a total monthly haul of $82 million.",
        "Donald Trump is indeed reforming his ways and softening his tone. Earlier this week, he called Hillary Clinton \u201dthe devil.\u201d Now, she\u2019s simply the \u201dfounder of ISIS.\u201d In his speech Wednesday afternoon in Daytona Beach, Fla. Trump appeared to be heeding his advisers\u2019 reported wishes and giving a subdued, speech criticizing Clinton\u2019s foreign policy in places like Libya. He said President Obama probably regretted making her secretary of state. Okay, that\u2019s at least plausible. Then he went back to . \u201dShe should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS,\u201d he said of the Islamic State.",
        "The last anyone heard of Robert Kennicott was\u00c2 his\u00c2 cheerful\u00c2 hum as he strolled\u00c2 into the Alaskan wilderness early on the morning of May 13, 1866. It was good to hear the scientist\u00c2 sing. It had been a long and punishing winter at Fort Nulato, where Kennicott\u2019s expedition\u00c2 to map the Yukon\u00c2 had spent the last five months, and he bore\u00c2 the setbacks badly. The frigid cold and endless dark left no time for exploration or research, a fact that\u00c2 rendered Kennicott \u201dentirely broken down,\u201d a\u00c2 friend wrote. This was not a young man used to failure.",
        "Let\u2019s talk fingers and buttons. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button,\u201d Hillary Clinton said about Donald Trump in June. \u201cI will not be a happy trigger like some people might be,\u201d Trump said on the \u201cToday\u201d show in April, adding: \u201cI will be the last to use nuclear weapons. \u201d \u201cA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,\u201d Clinton said during her convention speech July 28 in Philadelphia.",
        "In the 1870s, when Boss Tweed\u2019s Tammany Hall controlled New York City, and in the 1950s and 1960s, when Chicago\u2019s Democratic machine was especially rampant, there was a phenomenon that can be called immunity through profusion: Fresh scandals arrived with metronomic regularity, so there was no time to concentrate on any of them. The public, bewildered by blitzkriegs of bad behavior, was enervated. What Winston Churchill said about an adversary \u2014 \u201cHe spoke without a note, and almost without a point\u201d \u2014 can be said of Donald Trump, but this might be unfair to him.",
        "The writer is a retired U. S. Army major general. I am a former soldier who served our nation in uniform for more than 34 years. I was also Capt. Humayun Khan\u2019s combat brigade commander in Diyala province, Iraq, in 2004. I came to know Humayun after taking command of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, in Germany in 2002. The motto of our unit was \u201cNo mission too difficult. No sacrifice too great. Duty First!\u201d Humayun was a wonderful person, liked and respected by all who knew him.",
        "Of all the dangerous things Donald Trump has said, perhaps the most concerning is his assertion that the election might be rigged. This irresponsible, unsupported suggestion augurs poorly for Trump\u2019s behavior in the increasingly likely event of his loss. \u201cThe election\u2019s going to be rigged,\u201d Trump warned at a rally in Ohio. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, November 8, we\u2019d better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity. Those comments set the stage for an explosive outcome the likes of which this country has never seen.",
        "You might have missed it amid the recent Campaign 2016 turbulence, but there\u2019s been a major development on the economic front. The U. S. homeownership rate has just fallen to its lowest level since the Census Bureau began tracking it in 1965. During the second quarter of this year, only 62. 9 percent of U. S. households were residences, down from the high of 69. 2 percent reached in the fourth quarter of 2004. Contrary to entrenched conventional wisdom, however, the ongoing decline of the homeownership rate is actually good news.",
        "\u201cWhat does this say about your party that this is your ?\u201d The headlines from President Obama\u2019s excoriation of Donald Trump on Tuesday rightly highlighted his flat declaration that the Republican nominee is \u201cunfit to serve as president. \u201d But the challenge to Republican leaders who fell in line behind Trump was even more devastating. Obama was not simply condemning a man whose brutal cruelty finally came home to anyone with a heart after Trump\u2019s attacks on a Gold Star family.",
        "Jeff Flake and Mike Pence were the best of friends. Both men ran conservative think tanks before getting into politics, and both were elected to the House in the Republican class of 2000. Both were affable young lawmakers, happy warriors inspired by Ronald Reagan; covering Congress, I came to know and admire both of them. Pence in 2012 went home to Indiana as governor. Flake won election to the Senate the same year. \u201cHe was my closest friend during my time in the House, and I still see him whenever he comes to D.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court issued a stay in a case involving a transgender teen who is suing his school board for the right to use the boys\u2019 bathroom at his Virginia high school, a move that halts a court order that would have allowed the student to use the bathroom of his choice when the school year begins. Gavin Grimm, 17, sued the school board in Gloucester County, Va. last year after it passed a policy requiring students to use bathrooms corresponding with their \u201cbiological sex,\u201d resulting in him being barred from the boys\u2019 bathroom.",
        "A Metro Transit police officer has been arrested and charged with attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State, marking the first time a U. S. law enforcement officer has been accused of trying to aid the terrorist group. Nicholas Young, 36, of Fairfax, Va. was arrested Wednesday morning at Metropolitan Police Headquarters in Washington and his employment was terminated.",
        "President Obama granted clemency to a record 214 inmates on Wednesday, far surpassing his previous record, as part of an ongoing effort to release federal inmates serving prison terms deemed to be unduly harsh. To date, Obama has commuted the sentences of 562 federal inmates, more than the previous nine presidents combined. The White House said in a statement that the president will continue commuting the sentences of inmates through his remaining months in office.",
        "Closed for more than a year, Paris\u2019s St. Rita church, a crumbling structure tucked away in the quiet, 15th arrondissement of the French capital, had been slated for demolition for some time. But on Wednesday, in the immediate aftermath of the funeral of the Rev. Jacques Hamel, the beloved priest who was killed by two assailants inspired by the Islamic State as he celebrated Mass in Rouen last week, the church\u2019s destruction inspired a protest. Among those gathered were local residents who had long opposed the demolition.",
        "\u201cOur incompetent secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal!\u201d \u2014 tweet by Donald Trump, Aug. 3 The GOP presidential nominee jumped on an interesting report in the Wall Street Journal that the Obama administration shipped $400 million in cash to Iran at about the same time that four Americans being held in Iran were released after negotiations. Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump receiving a Purple Heart medal Tuesday from a wounded veteran is both acceptable and legal, according to military medal experts. But whether he handled it well is another matter. Trump, speaking Tuesday at Briar Woods High School in Ashburn, Va. told a crowd that \u201csomething very nice just happened\u201d to him \u2014 namely, that retired Army Lt. Col. Louis Dorfman gave him the Purple Heart he earned in combat.",
        "The fact that Donald Trump wasn\u2019t willing to say he supports House Speaker Paul Ryan in the Wisconsin Republican\u2019s primary fight later this month is big news. This is a sort of political that Trump is refusing to execute. But, if you closely read what Trump told WaPo\u2019s Phil Rucker about Ryan, there\u2019s something darker and more insidious going on here. It\u2019s not just that Trump isn\u2019t \u201dready\u201d \u2014 his words \u2014 to endorse Ryan. It\u2019s that Trump is using Rucker to transmit a threat to Ryan: Start talking nice about me \u2014 or else.",
        "SAYLORSBURG, Pa. \u2014 It was a weekday night in the Poconos, quiet but for the sound of cicadas in the wooded hills of rural Pennsylvania. In the secluded compound where he preaches nonviolence, tolerance and the value of education, Fethullah Gulen sat in a room, handing out candy to children. Half a world away in his native Turkey, the Muslim cleric with a global following had just been accused of orchestrating the bloody July 15 coup attempt that left more than 200 people dead and a major U. S. ally in chaos.",
        "On Aug. 1, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged pregnant women to avoid visiting a South Florida neighborhood where cases of the Zika virus have emerged. It was the first time officials have warned against travel to part of the continental United States because of the outbreak of an infectious disease. The travel advisory is for a area that includes Wynwood, one of Miami\u2019s trendiest neighborhoods, which has a diverse mix of art galleries, blocks of intricate murals and warehouse graffiti, and aging bungalows.",
        "Not to get too partisan or anything, but Jupiter\u2019s moons are probably some of the coolest worlds in the solar system. Two of its largest \u2014 Europa and Ganymede \u2014 likely contain subsurface oceans, providing tempting spots to go looking for life. But while potentially habitable waters may be especially intriguing to us earthlings, Jupiter\u2019s innermost moon Io is nothing to sneeze at, either. [Why scientists are so excited about the Juno probe that is finally orbiting Jupiter] It\u2019s a world practically bursting with intense volcanic activity that has unique interactions with its host planet.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: Some images in this gallery may be disturbing because of their violent or graphic nature. A drug trafficker poses with a weapon. (Felipe ) Photographer Felipe Dana was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, so he is no stranger to the city\u2019s violence. But his job as a journalist has given him insight into the violent world of Brazil\u2019s favelas that most ordinary citizens are immune to.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s flailing campaign has prompted Democrats to launch a new, broad effort to offer Hillary Clinton as a safe harbor for Republicans who find they can no longer stomach the GOP presidential nominee. Clinton\u2019s campaign is quietly broadening its outreach to potential Republican converts, including donors, elected officials, and business and foreign policy leaders. The message is simple: Even if you have never before considered voting for a Democrat, and even if you don\u2019t like Clinton, choosing her this year is a moral and patriotic imperative.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) sent an urgent fundraising appeal Thursday evening that warned: \u201cIf we fail to protect our majority in Congress, we could be handing President Hillary Clinton a blank check. \u201d Whether or not it was intentional, the phrase \u201cblank check\u201d has a political echo \u2014 one that suggests a deep fear by congressional Republicans that a sinking presidential candidate could take their majorities in the House and Senate with him, and that they are getting ready to desert him. It goes back 20 years, to an infamous chapter in internecine Republican politics.",
        "An hour before Mike Pence gave the biggest speech of his life at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, officials from Donald Trump\u2019s campaign read over the text for the first time. They made no changes. Eleven days later, Pence crafted a statement about the Muslim American parents of an Army officer killed in Iraq. It contained none of the vitriol that Trump had directed at the same family. Again, no changes. These moments, confirmed by several campaign aides, reveal an emerging dynamic between this Republican ticket: They\u2019re not always on the same page, and they don\u2019t always coordinate.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 On a recent morning, Andrea Pereira was taking in the wonders of the Olympic renovations in Rio, riding a sleek new train downtown with her family to the gleaming new \u201cWonderful Port\u201d plaza. And yet she felt bombarded by mixed feelings. Her city, the pulsing, jubilant, unequal, world champion of sunny celebrations, did in fact seem prettier now that the Summer Games were about to begin. But the military police officer has spent three months worrying over late or partial paychecks amid the state government\u2019s budgetary fiascos.",
        "Three decades ago, Congress listened to the plight of Americans sick with diseases so rare many people had never heard of them. They were victims of a pharmaceutical market failure \u2014 \u201corphans\u201d ignored by drug companies because, the thinking went, tiny groups of patients would lead to trifling sales. To make the business viable, Congress \u2014 pushed by patients and a popular television show that highlighted rare diseases \u2014 passed the Orphan Drug Act. The 1983 law offered drug companies attractive tax credits and monopolies to develop treatments for rare diseases, radically transforming the pipeline of orphan drugs.",
        "Donald Trump, the man who defied every political rule and prevailed to win his party\u2019s nomination, last week took on perhaps the most sacred political rule of all: Never attack a Gold Star family. Not just because it alienates a vital constituency but because it reveals a shocking absence of elementary decency and of natural empathy for the most profound of human sorrows \u2014 parental grief. Why did Trump do it? It wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was a revelation. It\u2019s that he can\u2019t help himself."
