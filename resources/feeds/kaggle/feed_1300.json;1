        "How did Donald Trump win the Republican nomination, despite clear evidence that he had misrepresented or falsified key issues throughout the campaign? Social scientists have some intriguing explanations for why people persist in misjudgments despite strong contrary evidence. Trump is a vivid and, to his critics, a frightening illustration of this perception problem. But it has been studied carefully by researchers for more than 30 years. Basically, the studies show that attempts to refute false information often backfire and lead people to hold on to their misperceptions even more strongly.",
        "A few days ago, I was asked on CNN to make sense of one more case in which Donald Trump had said something demonstrably false and then explained it away with a caustic tweet and an indignant interview. I replied that there was a pattern here and a term for a person who did this kind of thing: a \u201cbullshit artist. \u201d I got cheers and boos for the comment from partisans on both sides, but I was not using that label casually.",
        "John Feinstein, a Post contributor, has covered six Olympics and is most recently the author of \u201cThe Legends Club: Dean Smith, Mike Krzyzewski, Jim Valvano and an Epic College Basketball Rivalry. \u201d The argument can be made that there has never been a day in U. S. sports history more electric than Feb. 22, 1980. That was the afternoon when the U. S. Olympic hockey team stunned the mighty and seemingly unbeatable Soviet Union, in the Olympic Games in Lake Placid, N. Y.",
        "RODRIGO DUTERTE, the new president of the Philippines, is overseeing exactly what he pledged in his campaign: a terrifying surge of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers, users and criminals. From the day after he was elected, May 10, to Aug. 4, by a local account, there had been 571 killings, most of them simple executions by police and vigilante groups. Mr. Duterte promised to \u201cshoot to kill\u201d and eliminate drug dealing in the country in six months. In fact, he is killing the rule of law, and that could undermine Philippine democracy. Mr.",
        "President Obama vowed Thursday that the Islamic State is \u201cinevitably going to be defeated,\u201d but he predicted that the terrorist networks it spawns are likely to continue operating after the group loses its major strongholds in Iraq and Syria. Saying that recent battlefield defeats have shown that the Islamic State is \u201cnot invincible,\u201d Obama outlined a strategy to use a recently recaptured air base in Iraq as a hub for U. S. Iraqi forces to \u201cpush into Mosul,\u201d the major northern Iraqi city that the militants seized in 2014.",
        "Hurricanes, large and small, have eluded U. S. shores for record lengths of time. As population and wealth along parts of the U. S. coast have exploded since the last stormy period, experts dread the potential damage and harm once the drought ends. Three historically unprecedented droughts in landfalling U. S. hurricanes are presently active. A major hurricane hasn\u2019t hit the U. S. Gulf or East Coast in more than a decade. A major hurricane is one containing maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph and classified as Category 3 or higher on the wind scale.",
        "As a rising feminist legal scholar, Susan Estrich once wrote this in the Stanford Law Review: \u201cIt should be obvious that the system already contains serious disincentives to women filing sexual harassment complaints. Start with embarrassment, loss of privacy, and sometimes shame. If the woman remains employed, she faces the prospect that her harasser and others will make her life impossible. If she has quit or been fired . . . the danger is that she will be branded a troublemaker, and find it difficult to find another job. \u201d That was in 1991.",

        "As Fox News reported on the controversial transfer of $400 million in cash to Iran in January, it repeatedly played dark, grainy footage of shadowy figures walking off a small private plane with bags with hand. The video is often labeled as being from Jan. 17 in Geneva where three American hostages first landed after being released from Tehran. Republican nominee Donald Trump watched this sort of footage, according to his spokeswoman, and concluded that it showed the controversial money transfer that remained secret until this week when the Wall Street Journal broke the news.",
        "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2014 While the media again and again recounts Donald Trump\u2019s latest controversy, his supporters say they are nonplused. Telling the Russians to hack a former secretary of state\u2019s emails? A joke, many of them say. Insulting the family of fallen war hero? He was baited into it, they say. Refusing to endorse the reelection of Republican stalwarts such as Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis. )? They say Trump doesn\u2019t need the Republican leadership.",
        "You\u2019ve probably never heard of Mike Coffman. You almost certainly have that in common with Donald Trump. Coffman is a Republican member of Congress from Colorado. He happens to represent one of the most competitive House districts in the country. And he wants to make sure everyone is his district knows that he is no fan of his party\u2019s presidential nominee. \u201dPeople ask me, \u2019What do you think about Trump,\u2019\u201d Coffman says to the camera in a new ad. \u201dHonestly, I don\u2019t care for him much.",
        "HBO and Bradley Cooper are developing a miniseries based on Washington Post reporter Joby Warrick\u2019s 2016 Pulitzer book \u201cBlack Flags: The Rise of ISIS. \u201d Cooper, a Academy Award nominee, is also executive producing the project through Joint Effort, the production company he runs with Todd Phillips.

        "In real life, it seems Clint Eastwood has slowly morphed from the \u201cDirty Harry\u201d to his cranky old man character from \u201cGran Torino,\u201d complaining about today\u2019s generation and regretting the past, especially that speech to a chair. Just take a look at this interview he gave to Esquire in which he said that Donald Trump is \u201con to something\u201d and finally explained why he \u2014 a fully grown adult man \u2014 spoke to that empty chair at the 2012 Republican National Convention.

The New Yorker never made it for his volunteer shift on the afternoon of July 22. Instead, the driver of the other car punched Tse to the ground in an apparent bout of road rage, leaving Tse with black eyes and a brain hemorrhage. Tse was unconscious when police found him. The retiree would never recover.",
        "If there\u2019s one thing the sharply divided nation can agree on after nearly eight years of President Obama, it is that things have changed on his watch. Most notably, his appearance. Even the president has noticed. Opening his speech at the Democratic National Convention last week, Obama praised his wife, Michelle, the first lady, who \u201csomehow hasn\u2019t aged a day. \u201d \u201cI know the same cannot be said for me,\u201d Obama continued with a chuckle.",
        "Few may have noticed, but in the sumo wrestling world Wednesday, the Earth trembled. In the epic struggle for the heart of Japan between sumo belt and baseball bat, the former was sent tumbling with a charging blow. The International Olympic Committee announced that the five sports to be added to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics would be climbing, baseball and softball (counted as one sport) surfing, karate, and skateboarding \u2014 but not sumo wrestling. If there was ever a perfect opportunity to bolster interest in a sport so deeply rooted in Japanese culture, this would have been it.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 With the sound of crashing waves and smooth bossa nova, the Summer Games kicked off Friday night with an earthy, musical celebration of Brazilian culture, a dance party that highlighted the glories and tragedies of South America\u2019s largest nation. The Opening Ceremonies had a gutted budget but a soaring feel as the stadium in this seaside city pulsed with lights, fireworks, acrobatics and a samba singalong that embraced the nation\u2019s partying style.",
        "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday announced a new team of financiers and businessmen as his core economic advisers, a move that brings names to his inner circle but also may step on his populist claims to save America\u2019s middle class. The list includes strikingly few academic policy experts, usually the of campaign policy teams. Instead, the advisory team of 13 men \u2014 and no women \u2014 reflects a wide range of people from the higher echelons of American finance, including hedge fund managers and real estate investors.",
        "In an effort to clarify her most recent statements about her use of a private email server as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton on Friday only further muddled a controversy that has dogged her presidential candidacy from the start.

Comey had characterized as \u201dtruthful\u201d all of her public statements about her use of a private email server.",
        "In early June, a adviser to Donald Trump stunned a gathering of Washington foreign policy experts meeting with the visiting prime minister of India, going off topic with effusive praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump. The adviser, Carter Page, hailed Putin as stronger and more reliable than President Obama, according to three people who were present at the meeting at Blair House \u201d and then touted the positive effect a Trump presidency would have on U. S. relations. A month later, Page dumbfounded foreign policy experts again by giving another speech harshly critical of U. S.",
        "2016\u2019s unofficial motto is \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things. \u201d I can list on the fingers of one Ramsay hand all the good things that have happened in 2016, and most of them involve musicals about Founding Fathers winning meaningless awards. The election is going so badly that I have had to buy a whole thesaurus full of synonyms for \u201cgarbage fire. \u201d Both Prince and David Bowie took one look at this year and decided it was time to head back to the astral plane, leaving us to struggle alone.",
        "Two years ago, Karl Rove caused a stir when he planted a seed that Hillary Clinton might have suffered brain damage from a fall. My, how things have changed. Today, Clinton\u2019s brain seems to be working just fine, though it\u2019s less than clear that Donald Trump\u2019s is. Much has been written about Trump\u2019s narcissism, by which most people mean something beyond the \u201che\u2019s such a narcissist.",
        "Like shipwrecked mariners clinging to a floating mast, many Republicans rationalize supporting Donald Trump because of \u201cthe court. \u201d This incantation means: Because we care so much for the Constitution, it is supremely important to entrust to Trump the making of Supreme Court nominations. Well. In a Republican candidates debate, Trump complained that Ted Cruz had criticized Trump\u2019s sister, a federal judge. Trump said: \u201cHe\u2019s been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.",

        "A ll Americans should be alarmed by Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone\u2019s suggestion that Trump claim Hillary Clinton is trying to steal the election. Asserting that there is already \u201cwidespread voter fraud,\u201d Stone said Trump should say that \u201cif there\u2019s voter fraud, this election will be illegitimate . . . we will have a constitutional crisis, widespread civil disobedience, and the government will no longer be the government.",
        "Stephanie Coontz is the director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families and author of \u201cThe Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap. \u201d Older generations always seem to fret about the sexual behavior and romantic lives of the younger crowd. In the 1920s, there was alarm when boys stopped visiting in the parlor and started driving girls around in what one newspaper called \u201ca house of prostitution on wheels. \u201d This worry paled in comparison to the panic evoked by the rowdy sexual revolution that began in the late 1960s.",
        "Officials in Chicago on Friday released video footage from a fatal encounter between law enforcement and an car theft suspect who was killed by police in the shooting late last month.
