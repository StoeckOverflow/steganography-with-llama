        "Nervous and distraught, Earledreka White did the only thing she thought she could to allay her fears after being stopped by a police officer in Houston: She called 911 to report the traffic stop and asked for police backup. White\u2019s voice was so shaky that she stuttered when trying to give the emergency dispatcher their location, a medical plaza parking lot outside the Loop 610 near downtown Houston. Next to her stood an officer with Houston\u2019s Metro Police Department, waiting while she made the call in the doorway of her sedan.",
        "Scott Silverthorne built a reputation as a civic pillar of Fairfax City, Va. over three decades, helping bring a park to the affluent suburb\u2019s downtown and championing other improvements during his stints as a City Council member and mayor. But even as he was the public face of the city, police said, Silverthorne was privately leading another life online: using a website to swap methamphetamine for sex with other men.",
        "Will the last golfer on the course please turn off the cart? This was supposed to be a glowing moment for golf, the aristocratic pastime and business ritual that helped transform America into a quilt of green links and country clubs. Golf returns this summer as an Olympic sport for the first time in 112 years. Instead, the story of golf looks increasingly like a tale of surrender.",
        "Flint, Michigan. These two words once simply named a place, but now they evoke other ideas: environmental disaster, the loss of a middle class, an ailing auto industry, Michael Moore. For a small town with a population hovering around 102, 000, that\u2019s a supersized, multifaceted reputation. Canadian photographer Ian Brown chose to spend time in Flint while he pursued a larger project that is taking him across the United States to photograph citizens and to inquire about their versions of the phrase during election years, the American Dream.",
        "JANESVILLE, Wis. \u2014 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s Georgian revival house in this Midwestern neighborhood has long been his \u201crefuge,\u201d as his wife calls it, from the divisive world of politics. But no more \u2014 not in this Donald year for a Republican Party leader facing a primary challenge. Fuming activists have inched close to the Wisconsin congressman\u2019s property several times as part of protests that have drawn the notice of the U. S. Capitol Police detail that watches his residence. A nearby billboard has portrayed Ryan as soft on terrorism.",
        "\u201cThe press came out with headlines: \u2018Trump throws baby out of arena.\u2019 So dishonest. I mean these are dishonest people. I could give you 20 stories like that. Everyone\u2019s having fun, we\u2019re smiling, I\u2019m waving. Everyone\u2019s having fun, but they say Trump throws baby [out]. You know how terrible that is? It\u2019s such a lie. And they know it\u2019s a lie. \u201d \u2014 Donald Trump, speaking at a rally in Green Bay, Wis. Aug. 5, 2016 Donald Trump is complaining that the media has spun a fable that he kicked a baby out of his rally in Ashburn, Va.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 To swim the anchor leg of the women\u2019s freestyle relay Saturday night in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, the U. S. coaching staff could have chosen from among some of the most experienced, accomplished sprinters at its disposal \u2014 veteran swimmers with Olympic medals and world championship golds at 100 meters, youngsters with world rankings in the sprints. But the Americans\u2019 needed a miracle, so they went with Katie Ledecky.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 I would tell you what happened on the opening day of the Olympics, but as a woman, I\u2019m not really into results; I\u2019m more about the journey. I would give you the latest on French vaulter Samir Ait Said\u2019s horrifically broken leg, or tell you about the craziest bike race finish you\u2019ve ever seen, but those aren\u2019t things a woman particularly wants to know, according to NBC executives. So you can blame me for hijacking your viewing experience. Women don\u2019t watch the Olympics for the live results; they watch it for the narrative.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 A woman of modesty, I felt at first that my hotel\u2019s curtains were a bit sheer. But by Day 4 without luggage at the Rio Olympics, I was determined to fashion a garment from them, a la Scarlett O\u2019Hara. I\u2019ve long felt that international travel is a matter of perspective. If you measure everything against the comforts of home, you\u2019ll never be happy. The bed will always be too small; the drinks will never have enough ice.",
        "Democrats finished their party convention in Philadelphia celebrating their monopoly on optimism. Under the headline \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s Democratic Party Reclaims Morning in America,\u201d the Daily Beast\u2019s Michael Tomasky wrote: \u201cDonald Trump, and the millions who voted for him, turned the Republican Party into a party of rage about America. They spoke . . . about a country that has cancer. The Democrats spoke about a country that surely faces problems and challenges, but a country that has to and will choose optimism and hope.",
        "In a span of two weeks, federal courts have struck down voting restrictions in six states, including laws that required strict forms of ID in order to cast a ballot, cut back on days and made it harder to register. The rulings found that the laws \u2014 in Texas, North Carolina, Michigan, North Dakota, Kansas and Wisconsin \u2014 violated the Voting Rights Act by discriminating against people of color, sometimes \u201cwith almost surgical precision.",
        "I met my granddaughter for the first time in a prison visiting room. I\u2019ve been locked up in Maryland\u2019s women\u2019s prison for more than 18 years, since my daughter was 8 years old. In May of last year, she came to visit me carrying her newborn first child. I was overwhelmed with emotion as she placed the baby in my arms. I cried as I held my granddaughter, gave her a bottle and smelled her wonderful baby smell. It was a deeply meaningful moment. Unfortunately, it is now merely a memory.",
        "The television commercial begins simply: \u201cThis is a legal alert for the users of Xarelto. \u201d Lawyers, the narrator says, are reviewing claims that the drug can cause \u201csevere bleeding or hemorrhaging, stroke or even death. \u201d If affected, viewers are advised to call a number on the screen. \u201cYou may have a case,\u201d the speaker intones.

        "Amanda Erickson is an assistant editor of Outlook. In recent months, J. D. Vance has become a spokesman for the white working class, explaining why many of his \u201chillbilly\u201d friends will vote for Trump but why he won\u2019t. \u201cThese people \u2014 my people \u2014 are really struggling,\u201d he said in a recent American Conservative interview. \u201cAnd there hasn\u2019t been a single political candidate who speaks to those struggles in a long time.

        "Fifteen years ago, few Americans other than farmers seemed to be thinking much about hens. Backyard chicken coops weren\u2019t really a thing. No major animal rights group spent time or money on farm animal welfare. \u201cFactory farming\u201d wasn\u2019t yet a catchphrase. No longer.

        "During a recorded conversation, the star witness in the Chandra Levy murder case made a series of boastful claims. Armando Morales bragged about shooting gang rivals, obtaining hand grenades and making prison shanks out of melted foam cups. Then he made a chilling announcement. He said he was plotting to ambush a man he thought had stolen jewelry from the woman who was recording him. He said that he planned to execute his plan in a \u201cthug way,\u201d and that he had collected a black hoodie and some dark clothing so no one could see him coming.",
        "President Obama must approve operational plans to target overseas terrorist suspects with drones or other weapons outside war zones but in some cases does not sign off on specific strikes, according to newly declassified administration guidelines. In addition to setting out the role of the president, the guidelines emphasize the importance of \u201cverifying\u201d the identity of targets, even as they outline the criteria and legality of striking unidentified others when \u201cnecessary to achieve U. S. policy objectives. \u201d The guidelines provide rules for targeting U. S.",
        "HAMDEN, Conn. \u2014 Americans addicted to political polls can get their fix these days from a growing number of colleges and universities that measure the ups and downs of presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a tumultuous election year.

A group of Harvard Medical School students is trying to change that tradition, arguing that one of the three standardized tests required for medical licensing be eliminated.",
        "Within two days of landing in Istanbul, the city I now call home, I fell in love.

        "In her presidential bid, Hillary Clinton has made job creation a centerpiece of her platform, casting herself as a pragmatist who would inspire \u201cthe biggest investment in new, jobs since World War II. \u2019\u2019 Her argument that she would put more Americans to work has focused on her time in the Senate, when she took on the mission of creating jobs in chronically depressed Upstate New York.

        "This story has been updated Two Republican elected officials who have been critical of Donald Trump are voicing serious doubts about the mogul\u2019s ability to win their key battleground states of Ohio and Arizona, after the GOP presidential nominee suffered one of the most bruising weeks of his campaign. In television interviews broadcast Sunday, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen.

        "MOUNT PLEASANT, Wis. \u2014 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, in a golf shirt and khaki shorts, made the rounds here at Serbian Fest over the weekend, shaking hands with burly older men in aprons as they poured beer and sliced fresh cuts of pork.

        "Conventions are not complicated things. They are a few nights\u2019 worth of free media attention, during which each political party can make its best case to voters for the general election. There\u2019s lots of ceremony and far, far too many speakers, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s just one long ad for a candidate \u2014 and, essentially, the only time during the campaign when this happens.
