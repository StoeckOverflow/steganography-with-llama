        "Mohammed Madouh sat alone in the dark in the living room of the family house in the wee hours of Saturday morning in Kuwait, six time zones east of Rio de Janeiro, the only light beaming from the television. He wore Kuwait swimming shorts as he watched the Olympic Opening Ceremonies. He felt wavelets of sorrow and anger. He went to work Sunday, the first day of the Middle East work week, in a windowless office with white walls, amid seven desks, four empty.",
        "Anyone with confidence in the American people (and I have quite a lot of it) had to believe that Donald Trump\u2019s unpreparedness, instability and just plain meanness would catch up with him eventually. This, as the polls show, is what happened over the past week or so. Simply by revealing who he really is, Trump sent millions of voters fleeing him in disgust.",
        "So let\u2019s stipulate: Donald Trump is not Vladimir Putin\u2019s willing agent, and it\u2019s not certain if or to what extent Putin is trying to elect Trump president. The real issue is that Trump and Putin share the same nihilistic approach to international relations. Together, they could transform our world. Putin already has fostered a current of ruthless, cynical and utterly unprincipled opportunism in what, before his arrival, was thought of as an increasingly cooperative and rational international community.",
        "In the public imagination, no industry better symbolizes the downfall of U. S. manufacturing than steel. Shuttered plants dot the Midwest. Since 1973, steel employment has dropped 76 percent, from 610, 700 to 147, 300 in 2015. Moreover, the culprit seems clear \u2014 trade \u2014 and its influence seems pervasive: Manufacturing as a whole lost about 5 million jobs from 2000 to 2015. No wonder both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have jumped on the bandwagon. Globalization seems guilty as charged \u2014 except that the popular indictment is wildly misleading. Though trade has helped reshape U. S.",
        "Lawrence Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010. Issues of inequality, fairness, living standards and job creation have been central to the U. S. presidential campaign. Rightly so. For many years, the incomes of all groups tended to move together. Indeed, as a graduate student in the late 1970s, I was taught that it was a \u201cstylized fact\u201d that the shares of U. S.",
        "OF ALL the big companies, Aetna may have been the last anyone expected to pour cold water on Obamacare. The company has over the past several years enthusiastically participated in the marketplaces the law created. Now, Aetna just announced, it is canceling plans to expand its Affordable Care Act (ACA) business and reviewing its existing products. Aetna is not alone. UnitedHealth Group and Humana have recently made announcements in a similar vein.",
        "A CHINESE human rights lawyer held incommunicado for more than a year has \u201cconfessed\u201d to her crimes and been \u201creleased\u201d on bail \u2014 except the confession seems coerced, and no one has seen Wang Yu since her supposed release. Last summer, the Chinese government began a crackdown on what it called a \u201c criminal gang. \u201d That gang was really a group of lawyers who sought to hold the government to its own legal standards by exposing human rights violations, case by case.",
        "PHOENIX \u2014 After a lopsided string of court victories knocking down state voting restrictions, Democratic superlawyer Marc E. Elias was literally flying high last week in his pursuit of other voting laws he says hurt his party\u2019s most loyal constituencies. First up was the battleground of Ohio, where Elias told a federal appeals court that the state had unlawfully cut a few days of early voting disproportionately used by African Americans.",
        "Iran has executed a nuclear scientist who mysteriously turned up in the United States six years ago and returned to Tehran a few months later, authorities said Sunday, in the first official confirmation of the researcher\u2019s fate since he arrived back in his homeland. Iranian officials offered no details about the charges against Shahram Amiri, whose case has left unanswered questions about whether he voluntarily defected to the United States or \u2014 as he claimed \u2014 was abducted by agents while on a religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia in 2009.",
        "It started with Kahlua and coffee, the woman said. Then, she said, Bill Cosby asked her a question: \u201cDo you like back rubs or belly rubs?\u201d The setting was Cosby\u2019s hotel room one night in the after the comedian had appeared at Clemson University, the woman said, according to court records. What allegedly came next follows a familiar pattern in the accusations against the iconic entertainer. The woman, an anonymous Jane Doe accuser in a 2005 civil lawsuit against Cosby, said she rubbed Cosby\u2019s belly. That\u2019s when the story goes foggy. The woman said she passed out.",
        "\u201cSo I may have it and for that I, you know, will try to clarify because I think \u2014 you know, Chris Wallace and I, we\u2019re probably talking past each other be \u2014 because, of course, he could only talk to what I had told the FBI and I appreciated that. \u201d \u2014 Hillary Clinton, remarks to joint convention of black and Hispanic journalists, Aug. 5, 2016 All presidential campaigns try to seize on misstatements or gaffes made by their opponents.",
        "The effort to plant the seeds of white nationalism in the political mainstream, where they might blossom into political coalitions that appeal to a broader swath of Caucasian voters, will not be easy, according to the chairman of the American Nazi Party. But Rocky Suhayda thinks there is one political figure who presents a \u201creal opportunity\u201d to lessen the load. Who is it? Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president.",
        "Donald Trump unleashed a series of personal attacks Saturday against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, mocking her appearance and questioning her mental health several times during a New Hampshire campaign rally and on social media. \u201dShe is a totally unhinged person. She\u2019s unbalanced. And all you have to do is watch her, see her, read about her,\u201d Trump said during a campaign rally in Windham, N. H. Saturday evening.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u201d Pennsylvania s attorney general goes on trial Monday in a perjury and obstruction case that comes at the end of a tumultuous four years in office marked by petty feuds, a pornographic email scandal and political intrigue. Kathleen Kane remains on the job even though she lost her law license over her felony arrest. An ethics board accused her of egregious conduct ? amid criminal charges she leaked grand jury material to a newspaper to embarrass enemies and then lied about it under oath.",
        "Ichiro Suzuki became the 30th player in Major League Baseball history with 3, 000 hits, and only the second to reach the milestone with a triple, on Sunday at Coors Field. The was the only Marlins starter without a hit when he stepped to the plate in the seventh inning against Rockies reliever Chris Rusin. The only other player to hit a triple for his 3, 000th hit was Paul Molitor on Sept. 16, 1996. Ichiro collected the first 2, 533 hits of his major league career with the Mariners, with whom the Japanese outfielder spent 12 seasons.",
        "Seeking to put the most difficult stretch of his campaign behind him, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump used a major economic speech Monday to reach out to two voting blocs that remain critical to his faltering chances of winning in November: traditional fiscal conservatives and disaffected workers. But Trump faced a new round of resistance from within his party that threatened to stall his effort to move beyond the uproar he caused last week. In an opinion column published by The Washington Post late Monday, Sen.",
        "A group of 50 former national security officials, all of whom have served Republican presidents from Richard M. Nixon to George W. Bush, have signed an open letter calling Donald Trump unqualified to be president and warning that, if elected, \u201che would be the most reckless President in American history. \u201d The letter offers a withering critique of the GOP nominee, saying he \u201clacks the character, values and experience\u201d to be president. The signatories declare their conviction that he would be dangerous \u201cand would put at risk our country\u2019s national security and .",
        "Last October, at a rally in Las Vegas, a friend of Donald Trump\u2019s introduced the with a story about Trump\u2019s generosity. \u201dYou won\u2019t hear this in the media, but Donald gave $20 million to the St. Jude children\u2019s home. Twenty million dollars,\u201d said Phil Ruffin, the owner of the Treasure Island casino, which was the site of the rally. The crowd cheered. Trump mouthed \u201dThank you\u201d twice and waved. \u201dHe could have used that $20 million for television ads, but he decided to give with children with cancer,\u201d Ruffin said.",
        "Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia is holding fast to his belief that the current military operation against Islamic State forces has not been properly approved by Congress \u2014 a position that puts him at odds not only with President Obama but also with his running mate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Kaine placed the blame squarely on Congress for its inability to tackle the issue. \u201cI don\u2019t think the current legal authorities are sufficient to wage this war against ISIL,\u201d Kaine said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday, using an acronym for the Islamic State.",
        "Michael Phelps and the Olympic swimmers arrived in prime time Sunday night, and there was something unmistakable on their bodies: round circles. They weren\u2019t the result of a tattooing misadventure or a secret symbol known only to members of the swim team. Either of those would have made a great story. The circles came from cupping, a technique used by trainers who attach suction cups to pull blood to sore and injured areas to speed healing. A recent Under Armour video shows Phelps receiving the treatment, as he has done for years.",
        "World records? Olympic medals? History? Bah to all of it, apparently. What\u2019s really important, in this throwback summer of 2016, isn\u2019t the female athlete\u2019s achievements. It\u2019s who her husband is and what he\u2019s accomplished, not who she is and what she\u2019s accomplished. On Saturday, Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszu shattered a world record in the individual medley and the NBC commentators couldn\u2019t get enough \u2014 of her husband. Her race was with Shane Tusup\u2019s reaction. The analysts pointed him out as \u201cthe man responsible\u201d for her athletic turnaround.",
        "The latest polls from York Times and Post show Hillary Clinton with a secure lead, but they also show that voters believe her to be roughly as honest as veteran Donald Trump. This has clearly nettled close observers of this presidential race. Over the weekend two prominent columnists have attempted to outline the relationship between the major party nominees and the truth. On Sunday, the New York Times\u2019 Nick Kristof argued that when comparing Trump and Clinton as liars, Trump wins and it\u2019s not close: The idea that they are even in the same league is preposterous.",
        "Even some of Donald Trump\u2019s most supporters don\u2019t believe the snake oil that he is peddling on economics. In a rare moment of honesty, Newt Gingrich let on that Trump\u2019s tax and budget plans are nonsense. Asked by \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace whether Trump\u2019s plan to \u201ccut taxes $9. 5 trillion over the next decade, most of it going to top earners, and add[ing] $11. 2 trillion to the debt with unspecified spending cuts\u201d adds up, Gingrich said, \u201cOf course not.",
        "Last week, Donald Trump began telling his supporters, in both media appearances and stump speeches, that not only are polls that show him trailing being manipulated (after all, how could any honest poll not show him winning?) but also the election itself is going to be \u201crigged,\u201d so that his victory will be stolen from him by the powers that be. This idea is ludicrous for a number of reasons, and it\u2019s dangerous because of the delegitimizing effect it could have on the system and the eventual possible presidency of Hillary Clinton.",
        "We can\u2019t all do backflips on a beam, or even swim a few strokes of butterfly, but when the Olympics return to NBC, there\u2019s one sport we can all participate in: grumbling over the coverage. In particular, it\u2019s easy to burn out on the profiles that treat everything from parental abandonment to a routine injury as an epic struggle that magnifies the athletes\u2019 accomplishments in the Games, and that sometimes interfere with broadcasting the actual competitions in a timely or coherent way.",
        "Despite what you might read on Donald Trump\u2019s twitter feed, the Iranian execution of a nuclear scientist who defected to the United States and then changed his mind was not caused by Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. The scientist outed himself; it wasn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s fault. The Iranian government announced Sunday it had executed Shahram Amiri, a nuclear scientist who spent about 14 months in the United States in 2009 and 2010.",
        "Is Donald Trump experiencing a mental illness? That\u2019s the question making the rounds these days. The answer is: I don\u2019t know. And neither do the commentators, tweeters and psychiatrists \u2014 both licensed and armchair \u2014 who\u2019ve diagnosed him from afar as \u201ccrazy,\u201d a \u201cpsychopath,\u201d not \u201csane,\u201d having \u201cnarcissistic personality disorder\u201d and a \u201cscrew loose. \u201d What I do know is that we ought to stop casually throwing around terms like \u201ccrazy\u201d in this campaign and our daily lives.",
        "A systemwide computer outage at Delta Air Lines left passengers stranded and caused mass cancellations for customers who booked flights scheduled for Monday morning. [Delta grounds all flights due to computer outage] The problem is a reminder that, in our increasingly digital world, computer outages, no matter the cause, can wreak havoc on even the largest companies and the customers they serve. Here\u2019s what you need to know: What happened? The problem was caused by an early morning power outage in Atlanta, where the airline is based, according a statement from Delta.",
        "RAANANA, Israel \u2014 At 84 years old, Yona Yosef is full of life. Her eyes sparkle as she talks about her nine children and many grandchildren. But ask her what happened 67 years ago, when she and her family arrived in Israel from Yemen, and her eyes fill with tears. \u201cI was only 15. The people came, they told me to take Saadia to the clinic,\u201d said Yosef, her voice stalling as she recalled the day she took her for a routine for new arrivals. \u201cAt the clinic, they told me to go home.",
        "This story has been updated. On the last day of the Republican National Convention in July, Ivanka Trump strode across the stage in a dress from her namesake label. Then she shattered party norms, pledging that her father would revolutionize support for working mothers. \u201cPolicies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties,\u201d she declared. \u201cThey should be the norm. \u201d The eldest Trump daughter, 34, has built her personal brand around this cause, penning a book called \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d and leading the policy charge on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign."
