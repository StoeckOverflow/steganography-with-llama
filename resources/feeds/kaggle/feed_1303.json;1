        "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2014 Hillary Clinton cast the presidential election Monday as a moment of national reckoning \u2014 and rejection of Donald Trump as a national imperative. \u201cJust imagine Donald Trump in the Oval Office, facing a real crisis,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWhat happens when somebody gets under his skin? I don\u2019t know if the United States can afford that kind of risk. \u201d Campaigning in critical Florida, Clinton warned that voters should not be fooled by what she called an effort to refurbish the Republican nominee\u2019s image. \u201cThere is no other Donald Trump,\u201d Clinton said.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s response to criticisms from the Muslim American parents of a fallen Army captain last week was widely rejected by Republicans and Democrats and, according to a new poll, was overwhelmingly unpopular with the broader public. A Washington News poll found 12 percent of Americans approve and 73 percent disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of the exchange with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, including 56 percent who disapprove \u201dstrongly.\u201d Despite deep partisan divisions in the presidential contest overall, Trump\u2019s dispute with the Khans drew broad disapproval from across the political spectrum.",
        "Dear Science: How do I prevent my horrible hangovers? Isn\u2019t there any way to make it stop? Here\u2019s what science has to say: Oh, boy. Do we have a cure for you! There is a scientifically proven 100 percent effective way of stopping a hangover from happening, and it can be yours free: Don\u2019t drink. (If you need a moment to roll your eyes, go ahead. It\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll wait.) If you\u2019re going to drink \u2014 and it\u2019s cool if you do! We\u2019re all adults here \u2014 do so slowly and in moderation.",
        "Like thousands before them, Kelsey Friedrichsen and Josh Foster had come to ride the Verruckt. The couple could see it loom over the flat eastern Kansas countryside. Taller than Niagara Falls. Named after the German word for \u201cinsane. \u201d The largest waterslide in the world. [Three children, amazingly, survive 3 story fall from Tenn. ferris wheel] It was a warm day and Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, Kan. was busy. But as Friedrichsen and Foster approached the slide Sunday afternoon, they began to sense something was wrong.",
        "When the news about Chipotle\u2019s new burger chain, Tasty Made, got out last week, it left one burger company seeing double. Tasty Burger, a chain from Boston that just opened a location in Washington, alleges that Chipotle\u2019s burger concept is infringing on its trademark. When the news broke, \u201cWe started to get a deluge of emails and texts saying \u2018Chipotle took your name,\u2019\u201d said CEO David DuBois. His company\u2019s lawyers sent Chipotle a letter on July 19, but the burrito giant plans to move forward with Tasty Made anyway.",
        "Everyone has battled with parking at least once, but few have struggled this expensively. A woman driving a convertible Saturday morning ran over a $300, 000 red Ferrari parked behind her. The collision occurred at Katie\u2019s Cars & Coffee in Great Falls, Va. at a shopping center where car enthusiasts gather on Saturday mornings. A bystander captured the collision on video, which showed witnesses aghast and pointing at the incident as it unfolded. \u201cThat\u2019s a big, big problem,\u201d an onlooker is heard saying on video.",
        "A woman washes clothes. (Jane Hahn for The Washington Post) MALAKAL, South Sudan \u2014 Everyone in the displacement camp had an address. Rachael Mayik\u2019s was Sector 1, Block G. She lived in a white, tent deep inside a maze of other white tents, one dot amid the sea of people who had run here for their lives. [South Sudanese civilians fear the U.

        "WILMINGTON, N. C. \u2014 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, speaking at a rally in Wilmington, N. C. on Tuesday, appeared to encourage gun owners to take action if Hillary Clinton is elected president and appoints judges who oppose gun rights. The mogul said that Clinton \u201dwants to abolish, to essentially abolish the Second Amendment,\u201d a charge she has flatly denied. He said that if Clinton becomes president, she could appoint judges who would leave Americans nearly helpless on this front.",
        "WILSON, N. C. \u2014 With barely 90 days until the election, Donald Trump touched down Tuesday for a pair of rallies on the outskirts of eastern North Carolina, where tobacco was once king and conservative Democrats determined statewide elections. Trump\u2019s trip illustrated both his challenge and opportunity in the Tarheel State, where booming cities have given Democrats new hope for a win \u2014 but where deeply conservative swaths, including the eastern third of the state, remain fertile ground for Republicans. The trouble for Trump is that he has largely ignored these rural conservatives \u2014 until Tuesday.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Representatives of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign phoned state Democratic leaders in Arizona and Georgia this week to alert them of plans to begin transferring funds to hire more field organizers in those states, according to several Democratic officials familiar with the calls. Polls in both states \u2014 which Republican nominee Mitt Romney carried in 2012 \u2014 show a tightening race between Clinton and Donald Trump. The move by the Clinton campaign suggests a bid to expand the number of battleground states in play in November.",

        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Well before Tuesday\u2019s team final at Rio Olympic Arena, the five members of the U. S. Olympic women\u2019s gymnastics squad huddled via cellphone for an meeting. The sole agenda item: Come up with a nickname \u2014 something that would define them forever if they won team gold in Rio to take their place alongside the Magnificent Seven of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and the Fierce Five of the 2012 London Games. They swore to keep it a secret, like the best sisters do, until the time was right.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Before Lilly King was a Team USA breaststroker, she was a Newburgh (Ind.) Sea Creature, and before she was an Olympic gold medalist, she was a standout in the Southwest Indiana Swim League, and before she was a who took down a polarizing Russian rival this week in an episode that ignited a worldwide controversy, she was a who took down an older teammate for what young Lilly, a spitfire even back then, saw as an outrageous breach of competitive etiquette.",
        "\u201cHILLARY WANTS to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment,\u201d Donald Trump said Tuesday. \u201cBy the way, and if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know. \u201d The day after Mr. Trump delivered a relatively restrained speech on economic policy, the candidate once again trampled on Republican hopes that he would suddenly disguise himself as an acceptable politician. \u201cYou aren\u2019t just responsible for what you say,\u201d Gen. Michael Hayden, a former CIA director, said in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s remark.",

For years, ExxonMobil actively advanced the notion that its products had little or no impact on the Earth\u2019s environment. As recently as last year, it continued to fund organizations that play down the risks of carbon pollution. So what did ExxonMobil actually know about climate change? And when did it know it? Reasonable questions \u2014 particularly if ExxonMobil misled its investors about the prospects of its business model or if the company fooled consumers into buying its products based on false claims.",
        "Abdi Nor Iftin has lived in Yarmouth, Maine, since 2014. When Islamic terrorists killed a priest in France last month, it was news. Yet when terrorists in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, killed more than a dozen civilians that same day, the story received much less prominent coverage. This was despite the amazing revelation that one of the Mogadishu suicide bombers was reportedly a former member of the country\u2019s parliament \u2014 quite a news hook, as they say in journalism. As a Somali who spent years reporting from Mogadishu and Nairobi, I understand such editorial decisions.",
        "ASPEN, Colo. For 32 years, a group of Republican and Democratic experts has gathered here each summer to debate strategic issues facing the country. This year the bipartisan group had a strange imbalance: None of the Republicans was prepared to argue the case of the GOP nominee, Donald Trump. Trump would probably be pleased to know that he failed to muster support from the Aspen Strategy Group, as this gathering is known. In a sense, he s running against the elite establishment that the group represents.",
        "Every couple of years or so, I feel the need to whine about the plight of newspapers. It\u2019s August. I\u2019m Trumped out. So today\u2019s the day. Except that HBO\u2019s John Oliver beat me to it with the best defense of newspapers \u2014 ever. His recent \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver\u201d monologue about the suffering newspaper industry has gone viral in journalism circles but deserves a broader audience. Besides, it\u2019s funny.",

You walk out your front door into the heat and an anvil falls out of the oak tree on your head and flattens you like a pancake. It\u2019s the anvil you bought because it cost $150, which is a good deal for an anvil that size. You put the anvil up in the tree because you didn\u2019t want your wife to know.",

        "The speculation started within days of Seth Rich being gunned down in what D. C. police believe was an attempted robbery near his townhouse in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Northwest Washington. Word on the Internet was the young staffer with the Democratic National Committee was killed because he handed WikiLeaks the 20, 000 emails that embarrassed the DNC and forced the ouster of its chairwoman. Or he was killed because he was helping the FBI expose wrongdoing in the presidential election.",

        "Venezuela is stuck in a doom loop that\u2019s become a death spiral. Its stores are empty, its people are starving, and its government is to blame. It has tried to repeal the law of supply and demand, and, in the process, eliminated any incentive for businesses to actually sell things. The result is that the country with the largest oil reserves in the world now has to resort to forced labor just to try to feed itself. It gives new meaning to the revolution devouring its own. How has it come to this?",
        "Hillary Clinton was first lady when an influential legal journal featured her in its spring volume, drawing tributes from luminaries such as Elie Wiesel, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and the Queen of Jordan. But the most intimate portrait came from Diane Blair, a woman Clinton befriended in Arkansas who was not a Nobel laureate or legal scholar and never held elected office. Through 30 years of friendship, Blair knew more than perhaps anyone about Clinton\u2019s private struggles as she became the governor\u2019s wife, moved to the White House and transformed herself into the most famous woman in American politics.",
        "The Republican National Committee announced Tuesday the addition of three longtime African American party activists who will be charged with helping attract black voters, particularly in battleground states during the fall presidential election.

We\u2019ve got to find out whether Mr. Amiri, who was executed this last weekend, was essentially, he became public because of the revelations in Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. \u2026 It is heartbreaking to think that someone who would have cooperated, as reports indicated, with the United States and with our interests, to the security of our nation, would have lost their life because of the recklessness and carelessness of Hillary Clinton using a private server.",

        "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is steeped in lore \u2014 and that includes how cast members get removed from the show. While Hollywood isn\u2019t always so direct when it comes to firing, SNL\u2019s process can be particularly mysterious. A number of former cast members have said they were canned from the biggest break of their careers and left with little to no explanation. Two veteran cast members, Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah, as well as a featured player, Jon Rudnitsky, won\u2019t be returning for this fall for the show\u2019s 42nd season, a spokeswoman with NBC confirmed to The Post.",

In any given year, when the dark heavens cooperate, the Perseids could peak at 50 to 100 shooting stars an hour. This year, the International Meteor Organization thinks that number may increase to about 150 meteors an hour. Other astronomers are calling for up to 200 meteors an hour. Of course, nothing is a slam dunk.",
        "When Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, took a celebratory bus tour through crucial Ohio after the Democratic National Convention, they got some unexpected company: Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Portman\u2019s embattled reelection campaign had dispatched a squad of volunteers to rallies in Columbus and Youngstown. There, they passed out literature touting his endorsements by several traditionally Democratic unions, signed up 400 new supporters and gathered more than 100 requests for yard signs, said Corry Bliss, Portman\u2019s campaign manager. The campaign also featured Portman\u2019s outreach to Clinton supporters on its Facebook and Twitter accounts."
