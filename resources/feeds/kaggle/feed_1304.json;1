        "Baltimore\u2019s top law enforcement and political leaders on Wednesday vowed a sweeping overhaul of the city Police Department after a searing rebuke of the agency\u2019s practices, which the Justice Department said regularly discriminated against black residents in poor communities. Officials promised improved community relations, a purge of policing and a modernized department that better trains officers and holds them accountable. But they warned that reforming an agency entrenched in a culture of unconstitutional policing would be a slow process and could cost millions of dollars.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Feels good, doesn\u2019t it, to slap water in the face of the rest of the world and go all jingoist? Lilly King kept America strong and pure when she sent a blast of chlorine into the eyes of that Russian criminal mastermind Yulia Efimova, and prevented her from melting the earth\u2019s core. Or something like that, right? But there is a disquieting aspect to the narrative going here at the Olympics. It\u2019s not a moment of perfect American moral clarity.",
        "People are being downright unkind to an Ethiopian swimmer, him for having what, in one of the more charitable comments, is called a dad bod. Robel Kiros Habte \u201ccompeted\u201d in the men\u2019s freestyle heats on Tuesday and finished last in the heat. In yesterday\u2019s 100m freestyle prelims, Ethiopia\u2019s Robel Habte swam so slow he slipped off the screen pic. twitter. \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) August 10, 2016 Overall, he finished last among the 59 competitors in the eight heats with a time of 1 minute 4. 95 seconds. Habte confessed that his personal best was 59.",
        "For some Olympic athletes, Rio officials\u2019 attempts to fix the green pool water at the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center has only caused more problems. \u201cI could barely open my eyes for the final quarter,\u201d Team USA men\u2019s water polo captain Tony Azevedo told reporters after their victory over France on Wednesday. \u201cThis is the Olympic Games and they are putting so much chlorine in the water that people can\u2019t see. You can\u2019t have that. \u201d [The water in the Olympic diving pool is suddenly very, very green] Hungary\u2019s Gergo Zalanki agreed.",
        "The Muslim ban, the David Duke denial, the \u201cMexican\u201d judge flap, the draft dodger denigrating John McCain\u2019s military service, the son of privilege attacking an immigrant Gold Star mother and the constant revisionism and lying about past political positions taken are but a few of the lowlights that have punctuated Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic chase for the presidency. Any one of these offenses would have disqualified any other candidate for president. But the Republican nominee remained competitive against a historically weak Democratic nominee on the promise of bringing radical change and dramatic disruption to Washington. That appears to be changing.",
        "A day after dutifully reading a policy address to a bunch of people in suits, Donald Trump returned yesterday to his more comfortable oeuvre, the speech delivered to his supporters. And inevitably, he said something that made journalists rewind their DVRs and Democrats leap excitedly out of their chairs. Is it possible that Trump is being treated unfairly, that we jump on every little thing he says and twist his words, making a big deal out of nothing? Sure it is. That has happened before.",
        "Already this week, a letter from 50 respected Republican gurus announced that they would not support Donald Trump; Sen. Susan Collins ( ) wrote an declaring that she would not vote for Trump; and Trump once again roiled the race when he told a packed rally: \u201cBy the way, and if [Hillary Clinton] gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. The Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day. \u201d The Clinton team, not surprisingly, took this as an invitation to commit violence.",
        "James Hoefler is a professor of political science at Dickinson College specializing in American politics and public policy. The 2016 presidential election has been notable for the rhetorical vitriol pervading the campaign, and unfortunately Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion Tuesday that \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d might be able to offer some sort of corrective to a Hillary Clinton presidency is merely a continuation of this pattern. At a July rally in Raleigh, N. C.",
        "I\u2019ve read a lot of Justice Department reports on local police agencies. This is one of the worst I\u2019ve ever seen. Let\u2019s start with the broad strokes. These are all direct quotes from the report: \u201cBPD\u2019s legacy of zero tolerance enforcement continues to drive its policing in certain Baltimore neighborhoods and leads to unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests.",
        "Maybe the college student debt burden isn\u2019t so crushing after all. That\u2019s the surprising gist of a new study by economists at the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). It\u2019s surprising because burgeoning student debt has become a new economic worry and a political \u201ccause celebre. \u201d It adds to the hurt of millennials, who already face a tough job market and are living with parents in record numbers. Defaults could go higher. Strapped borrowers won\u2019t qualify for home loans. The recovery will suffer. Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton made proposals to lighten the debt load.",
        "An acute shortage of Air Force fighter pilots could grow even worse, with nearly a third of all jobs becoming vacant in the coming years, senior service officials said Wednesday. Air Force Secretary Deborah James said that the service could be short about 1, 000 fighter pilots \u201cin just a couple years,\u201d prompting the service to ask Congress for the ability to boost financial incentives to recruit and keep pilots. Data released to The Washington Post this spring indicates there are about 723 fighter pilot vacancies among 3, 495 jobs, leaving about 21 percent unfilled.",
        "BAGHDAD \u201d temperatures this summer have scorched countries from Morocco to Saudi Arabia and beyond, as climate experts warn that the severe weather could be a harbinger of worse to come. In coming decades, U. N. officials and climate scientists predict that the region s mushrooming populations will face extreme water scarcity, temperatures almost too hot for human survival and other consequences of global warming. If that happens, conflicts and refugee crises far greater than those now underway are probable, said Adel Abdellatif, a senior adviser at the U. N.",
        "The first rule of diplomacy? Don\u2019t call a foreign envoys the \u201dgay son of a whore.\u201d But that\u2019s exactly what Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines, did in televised remarks made Friday. Now Washington has reportedly summoned Manila\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires in Washington to complain, in what must have been a rather awkward meeting. Duterte, a former mayor who swept to power this spring, was telling reporters about his relationship with U. S. ambassador Philip Goldberg when he made the wildly homophobic \u2014 and utterly undiplomatic \u2014 remark.",
        "This story has been updated. On a warming Earth, seas inevitably rise, as ice on land melts and makes its way to the ocean. And not only that \u2014 the ocean itself swells, because warm water expands. We already know this is happening \u2014 according to NASA, seas are currently rising at a rate of 3. 5 millimeters per year, which converts to about 1. 4 inches per decade. However, scientists have long expected that the story should be even worse than this.",
        "To these 20 mothers in the electoral battlegrounds of Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix, the looming choice for president between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump inspires a mixture of fear, pain and disappointment. \u201cNauseated,\u201d said one woman. \u201cIt\u2019s like choosing which arm to cut off,\u201d said another. \u201cI kind of wish we could start all over,\u201d said a third. Such is the mood of America\u2019s undecided voters, just 89 days until Election Day. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton campaigns in Johnstown, Pa. on her bus tour late last month.",
        "A provision in Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform plan has the potential to deliver a large tax cut to companies in the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s vast business empire, experts say. Trump\u2019s plan would dramatically reduce taxes on what is known in tax circles as \u201c \u201d entities, which do not pay corporate income taxes, but whose owners are taxed at individual rates on their share of profits. Those entities are the most common structure for small businesses and increasingly popular for larger ones as well. They are also a cornerstone of the Trump Organization.",
        "The biased media is out to get Donald Trump again, it seems. Another and Trump comment about \u201dSecond Amendment people\u201d stopping Hillary Clinton from appointing judges has led the usual cycle of outrage, headlines and denial. Lots and lots of denial, in fact. The problem, though, is that the defenses offered by his campaign in the hours since Tuesday afternoon just don\u2019t make much sense, for one very important reason. Here\u2019s the comment at issue, which Trump made at a rally Tuesday in North Carolina: \u201dHillary wants to abolish essentially abolish the Second Amendment.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 North Korea has made some claims over the years about its pharmaceutical products. Like the injections that cure everything from bird and camel flu to diabetes and \u201cspontaneous gangrene. \u201d And like \u201c\u201d North Korea\u2019s purportedly herbal version of Pfizer\u2019s superstar medicine. According to the box, it not only counteracts \u201csexual dysfunction\u201d in both men and women, but relieves back pain and high blood pressure. Well, chuckle no more. It turns out that might actually work.",
        "Mary Knowlton arrived at the Punta Gorda, Fla. police station Tuesday night to learn how to be a community steward. The was there as a student in the citizens police academy, a course intended to give an intimate look at what makes the department in the quaint Florida town work. On this night, the group of 35 would tour the station and talk with officers, an essential part of academy curriculum that has gained popularity across the country amid a heated national debate about police violence. When it came time to get involved, Knowlton volunteered.",
        "It was not yet dawn\u00c2 when\u00c2 the armored vehicles, black and hulking like Batmobiles, rumbled into the\u00c2 residential neighborhood in Compton, Calif. A carjacker had stolen a vehicle\u00c2 in Los Angeles, exchanged gunfire with sheriff s deputies and then ditched his prize, disappearing on foot into a dense patchwork quilt of pink houses. The armored vehicles \u201d\u00c2 and the heavily armed deputies inside\u00c2 them \u201d\u00c2 were there to find and\u00c2 capture the armed carjacker. Instead, they found a different black man, Donnell Thompson.",
        "Harold F. Baquet\u2019s interest in photography began at age 11, when he snuck a photo of his cousin, Myrtle. \u201cA year later, she passed away, and I had that picture,\u201d he said in a 2010 interview. \u201dI had a treasure I could hold in my hand. \u201d A New Orleanian, Baquet\u2019s work documented his city, specifically the African American community. His admiration for craft was evident in the subjects he chose to photograph, including laborers, shoe shiners, musicians and barbers.",
        "WARREN, Mich. \u2014 Hillary Clinton on Thursday sought to undermine the central premise of Republican Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 that he would bring relief to economically beleaguered Americans \u2014 by casting him as a fraud and claiming that his proposals would help \u201conly millionaires like himself. \u201d Clinton used what was nominally described as an economic speech to press her case that Trump\u2019s proposals and actions run counter to his campaign promises to lift workers and energize the economy.",
        "Billionaire Paul Singer was an early and generous backer of Mitt Romney in the 2012 campaign, investing $1 million in a super PAC supporting the Republican presidential nominee more than a year before the election. In this year\u2019s White House contest, however, the hedge fund magnate has made clear that he\u2019s not putting any resources behind Donald Trump. Instead, Singer is spreading his money down the Republican ballot: He shelled out more than $7 million through the end of June to nine super PACs backing congressional candidates. He\u2019s in good company.",
        "A former staffer for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign alleged in a lawsuit this week that a top aide in North Carolina pulled out a gun while the pair traveled together in February and held the loaded firearm to the staffer\u2019s kneecap. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in North Carolina, was obtained and posted online by WBTV, a station in Charlotte. In the filing, Vincent Bordini claims Earl Phillip pulled the pistol on him as the pair traveled in South Carolina in February. At the time, Phillip was the campaign\u2019s North Carolina state director, a position he has since ceded.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 If there\u2019s a quibble to make with Simone Biles, it\u2019s that she competes with such joy and such weightless effervescence that she does herself a disservice, in a way, by making gymnastics look so easy. You won\u2019t catch her grimacing. She will never double over with exhaustion, tongue dangling, between routines. For Biles, flipping through the air is such fun, such a party, that no theatrics are needed other than the few flecks of glitter with which she lines her eyes so they match her sparkly leotard.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Katie Ledecky is a freestyler at 100 meters, as when she anchored the U. S. women\u2019s 4x100 free relay to the silver medal on the first night of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. She is the best female in the world at 200 meters, having won Olympic gold, and the best in history at 400, with an additional gold plus a new world record this week. But those were mere for the 800 free, an event in which Ledecky is so dominant, and so peerless, she nearly breaks the sport of swimming.",
        "You may be thrilled by the feats of Katie Ledecky, mesmerized by the grace of the women gymnasts, startled by Rio spectators mocking U. S. soccer star Hope Solo with chants of \u201cZika! Zika!\u201d (the first recorded instance, noted one wit, of a stadium rocking to the invocation of a virus). Allow me, however, to interrupt the prepackaged, Olympic coverage to bring you the real sporting news of the year. It has just been announced that on November 11 in New York City the World Chess Championship will begin. You scoff, of course.",
        "On a crackly Skype line from Ankara, Turkey, the story I heard was both new and strangely familiar. I was speaking to an academic, a man with a belief in freedom and free markets, and he was telling me about the arrests, detentions and firings of his colleagues. Sahin Alpay, a liberal journalist with wide European contacts. Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a human rights activist and journalist. \u0130hsan Dagi, a professor of international relations and theorist of democracy. Lale Kemal, a journalist who writes about the military and security. And there were others.",
        "Paul Ryan\u2019s empty chastisements of Donald Trump\u2019s failures of leadership remind me of my own periodic bouts of highly ineffectual parenting. With every morally reprehensible, politically dangerous and socially damaging attack Trump makes on decency, constitutionalism and individual people, Ryan produces yet another talk bubble of coddling enablement. Ryan is about to write himself into history as one of those who were asleep at the switch at a pivotal moment of American political decline. On Trump\u2019s comments about how supporters of the Second Amendment should respond to Hillary Clinton, he said: \u201cIt sounds like just a joke gone bad.",
        "Mark Holden is general counsel and senior vice president at Koch Industries. Ronal Serpas is a former superintendent of the New Orleans and Nashville police departments and the chairman of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration. There has been a surge of assertions about rising crime recently. At the Republican convention in July, GOP nominee Donald Trump said, \u201cDecades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration\u2019s rollback of criminal enforcement."
