        "Many Republicans are being driven mad by hope. In the moments between Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on grieving parents and his joke about assassination, GOP loyalists are grasping at any straw of competence or sanity to justify their continued support of a presidential campaign. So Trump\u2019s recent speech at the Detroit Economic Club was received by some conservatives with grateful praise as \u201cunifying\u201d and a \u201cgood first step. \u201d It was, in fact, the least appealing, least creative, least coherent economic address I have ever had the extreme displeasure of reviewing.",

        "People tend to hate computer passwords, that often nonsensical jumble of letters, numbers and special keystrokes said to be essential for digital security. The secret codes seem impossible to remember. It\u2019s why every login page has a \u201cForgot password?\u201d life preserver. The struggle even has a name: Password rage. Now, a new standard is emerging for passwords, backed by a growing number of businesses and government agencies \u2014 to the relief of computer users everywhere. No longer must passwords be changed so often, or include an incomprehensible string of special characters.",
        "After a Baltimore woman reported her rape to police, the prosecutor on the case shared his thoughts with an officer. \u201cI am not excited about charging it,\u201d the unnamed official wrote in an email. \u201cThis victim seems like a conniving little whore. \u201d \u201cLmao!\u201d the officer wrote back. \u201cI feel the same. \u201d The Justice Department unearthed the exchange in a sprawling Aug. 10 report on the Baltimore Police Department, which found rampant discrimination against black residents, a tendency to use excessive force and a rash of illegal arrests.",

Glenn was a devout Christian who volunteered at church, mentoring kids in an program. By day, he worked as an applications developer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and he was well on his way to becoming \u201ca great dad and a good provider,\u201d Clark said. Glenn was a gentleman, too. Clark noticed that he\u2019d hold doors open for Anna, even at the grocery store. Her daughter seemed happy, she said.",
        "ORLANDO \u2014 Donald Trump urged evangelical Christians to rally behind him in a speech here Thursday, seeking to ease their concerns about the Republican presidential nominee and proclaiming that sending him to the White House is crucial for the future of their movement. Trump tried to draw a direct distinction between himself and Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 nominee, who would have become the nation\u2019s first Mormon president. Echoing some analysis showing that Romney\u2019s religion led some evangelicals to stay home, Trump said \u201creligion didn\u2019t get out and vote\u201d for the former governor, \u201cwhatever the reason.",

From Houston to Marquette, Mich. and from Miami to Bangor, Maine, humidity is oppressively high. This is no ordinary deep tropical air mass. Levels of atmospheric moisture streaming into the Lower 48 from the Gulf of Mexico are among the highest ever recorded.

Now, 152 years later, it again is a subject of their anxiety. Entering 1864, Abraham Lincoln and his party were intensely, and reasonably, in doubt about his reelection. So, scrambling for every electorate vote, Republicans decided to conjure three from thin air \u2014 thin desert air.
