        "The ancient Greeks and Romans wrote grisly legends about Mount Lykaion. The Arcadian peak, some would write, was where one of the first Greeks tried to trick Zeus by feeding him a sacrifice tainted with human flesh. In punishment, the legend goes, Lycaon was either slain or turned into a wolf. As a result, according to some ancient writers, the firepit altar at the top of the mountain didn\u2019t just receive gifts of livestock from the people of ancient Greece.",
        "NAIROBI \u2014 The U. N. Security Council voted Friday to strengthen its peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, where an outbreak of violence has sparked concerns about a resumption of civil war. An additional 4, 000 peacekeepers will be dispatched, making the total deployment 17, 000 troops, and U. N. forces will be asked to take more \u201cproactive\u201d measures to protect civilians.",
        "(Scott ) Scott Typaldos has felt compelled to shine a light on the conditions that people with mental illness are living in around the world. He first began his project in 2011 when he photographed at the Accra Psychiatric Hospital in Ghana. While in Ghana, he photographed in \u201cprayer camps\u201d where he witnessed patients being chained to trees or to walls. Typaldos\u2019s compulsion to shed light on the conditions mental health patients live under has now spanned five years and has taken him to Ghana, Togo, Kosovo and in the latest chapter of his project, Indonesia.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 The hacking of Democratic Party computer systems, widely thought by U. S. intelligence officials to be the work of the Russian government, may be giving Washington a new taste of unconventional Kremlin tactics that have long been employed to influence politics in neighboring European countries. Russia has tried hard in recent years to tug Europe to its side, bankrolling the continent\u2019s extremist political parties, working to fuel a backlash against migrants and using its vast energy resources as a cudgel against its neighbors.",
        "The unraveling of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy continues apace, a long and steady decline since the high point three months ago. If he were deliberately trying to avoid winning the election, he could hardly be doing a better job. The hole he has dug for himself is wide and deep. National polls and battleground state polls all tell a similar story. Hillary Clinton has opened up a lead over Trump almost everywhere it counts. Unless Trump can reverse course, Clinton, despite persistent questions about her honesty, is on track to win a handsome electoral college majority.",
        "This article was reported by Philip Rucker in Fort Collins, Colo.; Robert Costa in Madison, Wis.; Abby Phillip in Austin and Fort Worth; John Wagner in Washington; Dan Balz in Palo Alto, Calif. and Seaside, Calif.; and Isaac in Goldsboro, N. C. and Norfolk, Va. FORT COLLINS, Colo. \u2014 Jo Tongue doesn\u2019t have much time for politics, but the Hillary and Trump show is hard to tune out. And even harder to take.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The tears rolling down Bruce Gemmell\u2019s face in the wee hours Saturday morning were four years in the making, and you couldn\u2019t possibly understand their genesis if you hadn\u2019t been there for the ride \u2014 if you hadn\u2019t seen the daily 5 a. m. workouts and the 70, 000 weekly yards of training and the countless sets that left Katie Ledecky on the verge of vomiting one moment, but ready for more the next.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The sky over Centre Court provided a backdrop of magical beauty, an appropriate setting for the history Monica Puig intended to make. Angelique Kerber stood across the net, and Puig\u2019s other opponent \u2014 the past \u2014 tinged the women\u2019s gold medal final with her small island\u2019s convoluted Olympic saga. A Puerto Rican had won gold before, but never had an athlete representing the island, a territory of the United States, climbed to the top of the podium and listened to the anthem, \u201cLa Borinque\u00f1a.",
        "Reflexively, I type \u201cDru\u201d and the Drudge Report pops up. I hate myself for going there but as a columnist ever in search of the zeitgeist\u2019s ultimate wave, I am behooved. Breezing past the latest tricklings about The Hill & Trumpie Show \u2014 I\u2019m not proud of this \u2014 I click on \u201cWeiner still at it?\u201d Hey, it\u2019s August. It\u2019s what we do.

        "Torrential rains have caused massive flooding in rivers and creeks in states along the Gulf Coast this weekend, leaving at least two people dead and a trail of damage. More than 1, 000 have been rescued in Louisiana from the waters, found in homes, cars and even clinging to trees. The rains are expected to continue, sweeping westward into Texas. Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) declared a state of emergency in Louisiana on Friday, and many of the state\u2019s parishes have urged their residents to evacuate. Mississippi Gov.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 The leader of a New York City mosque and an associate were fatally shot in a brazen daylight attack as they left afternoon prayers Saturday. Police said Imam Maulama Akonjee and his associate, Tharam Uddin, were shot in the back of the head as they left the Jame Masjid mosque in the Ozone Park section of Queens shortly before 2 p. m. Both men were pronounced dead later Saturday, an administrator at Jamaica Hospital said.",
        "HOBOKEN, N. J. \u201d The tavern that Tom Brennan has run for decades sits two blocks from the waterfront here, with views of the gleaming Manhattan skyline across the Hudson River. Like much of Hoboken, his business was devastated four years ago when the massive storm surge from Hurricane Sandy filled this city like a bathtub, knocking out the power grid, swamping train tunnels, stranding residents, flooding homes and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. But unlike most of Hoboken, Brennan s tavern would remain unprotected by the leading proposals to defend against the next superstorm.",
        "They stream into the picturesque colonial town by the hundreds, day and night. Groups of teenagers. duos. Couples on dates. A government worker just stopping by on her commute home along Interstate 95. They huddle in front of the town hall, gather in circles on the boardwalk, cram onto the brick sidewalks and overflow into the street. They stare at their phones and flick their fingers across the screens in a zombielike rhythm that easily could be mistaken for a scene from a dystopian, future.",
        "If you\u2019ve ever had anything resembling a Kit Kat bar in a restaurant, thank Michel Richard. A lot of chefs see something fun in the world and make convincing copies. Richard \u2014 born in France but long a cheerleader for America \u2014 not only improved on the original candy bar, he turned it into something diners experienced as fine art and countless competitors tried to emulate.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Kenny Baker played the lovable droid in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d films, achieving cult status and fans\u2019 adulation without showing his face or speaking any lines. The (1. 1 meter) performer \u2014 a word he preferred to actor \u2014 inside the costume has died at 81. Baker\u2019s nephew and carer, Drew Myerscough, said he found Baker dead Saturday at his home in Preston, northwest England. Myerscough told Sky News that Baker had suffered years of breathing problems, \u201cwhich he had borne very bravely.",
        "Fighting in the Syrian city of Aleppo for several days has cut off the flow of water to millions of residents as a humanitarian crisis shows signs of spreading from opposition neighborhoods to districts. Escalating assaults between government soldiers and rebels for control of this key northern city appear to be turning into a crucial battle in the conflict, which has killed more than 250, 000 people and displaced millions. The western districts held by Syrian President Bashar have not experienced the severe deprivations of areas in the east controlled by rebel forces.",
        "DENVER \u2014 Glenn Beck had traveled across the country to stop Donald Trump from winning the Republican nomination. He didn\u2019t succeed. Pacing the stage here at the RedState Gathering, a conference for conservative activists being held this weekend, Beck acknowledged that many Republicans would vote for Trump to stop Hillary Clinton from winning the presidency. He wouldn\u2019t. \u201cI know, as a recovering alcoholic, that the truth will set you free,\u201d Beck said Friday. \u201cThis election is between two choices that suck. \u201d Hundreds of conservative activists and bloggers cheered. None of them booed.",
        "DENVER \u2014 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is asking supporters to become election monitors, warning voters Friday night that \u201ccheating\u201d might rob him of a win. At the same time, outside groups are readying to help the campaign watch the polls. Donald F. McGahn II, the Trump campaign\u2019s attorney, stopped by the Denver meeting of the Republican National Lawyers Association to plot the strategy and explain how the campaign could help the lawyers build a sophisticated network.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s had a rough couple of weeks since the GOP convention. A string of controversies and plummeting poll numbers have some observers speculating about the possibility of a Hillary Clinton blowout in November. Trump is facing some polling difficulties not because Hillary Clinton is particularly popular but because he is proving to be surprisingly unpopular among Republicans. And a recent Reddit thread provides some fascinating testimonials to back that up.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Hugh Grant is having a Hugh Grant moment in a luxury hotel suite near the tip of Lower Manhattan. Greeting a guest with an offer of refreshment, he hovers over an espresso maker, holding a delicate little demitasse cup. The mischievous machine, though, spews more liquid than the cup can contain, and soon Grant is left standing there, like one of those charmingly thwarted gentlemen in a Hugh Grant comedy, watching a minor mechanical catastrophe unfold.",
        "Matcha tea has been touted as a superfood because it\u2019s high in antioxidants and vitamins. But most who drink it have a simpler mission: It\u2019s their morning cuppa. A majority of Americans drink at least one caffeinated beverage per day, but the side effects can be unpleasant. Vandana Sheth, a registered dietician for 18 years, said many of her clients want a morning jolt but do not like the headaches, racing heart and sweaty palms that go along with several cups of coffee.",
        "It\u2019s been a long summer. Recent life changes \u2014 divorce, moving and all the attendant logistical challenges \u2014 have put the squeeze on my wallet, so much so that I can\u2019t afford even my customary week in Ocean City, Md. Those circumstances have put the squeeze on my calendar, too. As a self employed, freelancer, I am aware that time spent on vacation is time spent not earning money.",
        "PARIS \u2014 After three major terrorist attacks in the last year and a half, public outrage has forced the French government to respond. But one particular proposal has generated significant controversy: the shutdown of certain mosques and the foreign funding behind them. Late last month \u2014 weeks after the Nice attack \u2014 Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for an outright ban on the foreign funding of mosques in France \u201cfor a period to be determined.",
        "It\u2019s one of the most intriguing stories of the summer, a tale of sex, money, politics and corporate skullduggery that would seem especially ripe for coverage and discussion by the firebrands at Fox News. Except Fox News barely seems to have noticed. Ever since former Fox host Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment suit July 6 against the network\u2019s and chairman, Roger Ailes, Fox has been about telling its viewers about the allegations, which have turned the network upside down.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 The men who gathered on the steps of the small, Jame mosque Sunday had a message for the authorities. \u201cWe want justice,\u201d Badrul Khan, the mosque\u2019s founder, said as a dozen men crowded beside him repeated the chant before a line of TV cameras, reporters and police. Tension is gripping this corner of Queens, particularly its large Bengali immigrant community, a day after Jame\u2019s imam and his assistant were shot at range in the head on a sidewalk just a few blocks from the mosque in the Ozone Park neighborhood.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Almost from the time she could toddle, Simone Biles was getting in trouble for jumping and flipping around the furniture. As a young teen, she was initially dismissed by veteran coach Martha Karolyi as \u201cjust this bouncy thing\u201d \u2014 a girl with an uncanny knack for acrobatics but no sign of the discipline required for elite gymnastics. Now 19, Biles has proven Karolyi wrong countless times since, much to the coach\u2019s delight, winning three world championships and, here at the Rio Olympics, leading the U. S.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The three other United States swimmers were lying on the ground, following their assailant\u2019s orders, when the gunman turned to Ryan Lochte, one of Team USA\u2019s charming stars. \u201cI\u2019m not getting on the ground,\u201d Lochte said, as he recounted to NBC News the story of the armed robbery he endured early Sunday morning. \u201cAnd then the guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, \u2018Get down,\u2019 and I put my hands up. I was like, \u2018Whatever. \u2019\u201d The four swimmers on the U. S.",
        "Simone Manuel, Katie Ledecky and Simone Biles will not be eligible to run for president until 2032, although Michael Phelps hits 35 years old in 2020. After watching these Olympians display so many traits we admire \u2014 persistence, discipline, grace, goal orientation, resilience, inner strength \u2014 perhaps we should consider drafting one of them someday. It is a blessing and a curse that the Summer Olympics happen during the election year. The blessings are obvious. Especially in this campaign, it is a relief to watch a display of American talent that truly brings the country together.",
        "President Obama\u2019s drive for a legacy is making U. S. allies nervous about their own security. Several allied governments have lobbied the administration not to change U. S. policy by promising never to be the first to use them in a conflict. The governments of Japan, South Korea, France and Britain have all privately communicated their concerns about a potential declaration by President Obama of a \u201cno first use\u201d policy for the United States. U. S.",
        "If he doesn\u2019t ultimately win the election and shred our Constitution, the most annoying thing about Donald Trump may end up being this: He forced us to devote so much of our lives to a man who is, fundamentally, a bore. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m as addicted to coverage of his \u2019t campaign as everyone else. Even if we wanted to avert our eyes, as citizens we would have a duty not to, to learn as much about the man and his potential presidency as we can."
