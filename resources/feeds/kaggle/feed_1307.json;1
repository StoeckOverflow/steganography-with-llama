        "A great mystery of our time \u2014 one that should frame the campaign debate \u2014 is why the economic recovery has been so sluggish. Consider this comparison. After the brutal recession of the early 1980s (peak unemployment: 10. 8 percent) it took only 11 months for employment to regain its level. By contrast, it required 51 months after the Great Recession for employment to reach its numbers. Either economic policy let us down or the economy has become less robust. Maybe both. We expected better.",
        "EVEN AS capital punishment becomes less frequent, killing remains punishable by death in 31 states. In Texas, so is not killing: If the state goes through with the execution of Jeffery Wood, slated for Aug. 24, a man will die for a murder he did not commit and is not accused of committing. Twenty years ago, Mr. Wood made a plan with a friend to steal a safe from a store in Kerr County, Tex. While Daniel Reneau entered the store and shot the clerk, Mr. Wood sat outside in a truck. He was never armed.",
        "IN ANOTHER election year with an opponent who is not so obviously unqualified, last week\u2019s revelations about connections between Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department and the Clinton Foundation would have been bigger news. Though it is an exaggeration to claim that Ms. Clinton ran her agency as a operation, the latest unearthed emails from the Clinton State Department nevertheless reveal that the ethical wall she was supposed to have built between herself and her family\u2019s organization was not impermeable enough.",
        "SANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 With the solemnity of a priest, Tastemade programming chief Oren Katzeff paces near his studio kitchen and assesses his media giant\u2019s latest creation: latkes, baked on camera for five seconds of Snapchat fame. In four years, his video network has transformed food porn designed for digital natives into a global juggernaut. But the competition is fierce \u2014 and the demands are endless \u2014 if he wants Tastemade to stay one of the media empires on the Web.",
        "In August 1966, as the Beatles made their way to Washington during what would ultimately be their last tour, a group of six scheming from the District\u2019s Chevy Chase neighborhood developed a plan: 1. See the concert. 2. For free. 3. By sneaking into what then was called D. C. Stadium. 4. Disguised as the Beatles\u2019 opening act, a band called the Cyrkle. Incorporated into this plan were makeshift costumes, a rented limo, decoy groupies and the unwitting participation of D. C. police, who provided the fake band with a motorcade escort.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s assessment of the media has been amended a bit this weekend, thanks to a New York Times article reiterating questions about Trump\u2019s ability to suddenly emerge from his cocoon as a general election butterfly. At a rally Saturday night, Trump disparaged the Times and reiterated his objection to how his events are covered. He continued the theme on Sunday morning on Twitter. The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I said \u2014 Donald J.",
        "I spent the past six days on an island with no cars, limited Internet and a finite number \u2014 30? \u2014 of paper copies of the New York Times for sale. It felt like exactly what I needed after the dead sprint of the 2016 campaign that had culminated with the two party conventions at the end of last month. Get away from it all, I thought, even if only for a few days. Little did I know that Donald Trump would follow me to Fire Island.",

The younger Barry died of an apparent drug overdose, according to reports. His girlfriend found him, and he was taken to George Washington University Hospital. Barry had struggled with drug use. He ran unsuccessfully for the Ward 8 council seat last year after his father died. Barry had brushes with the law, including charges related to an alleged outburst at a Chinatown bank branch.",
        "When Mark Boal spent 25 hours interviewing accused U. S. Army deserter Bowe Bergdahl, he didn\u2019t plan on those hours of recorded interviews becoming part of a hugely popular podcast. He was just reporting, as he had many times before \u2014 whether for his magazine articles or his filmmaking. But in collaboration with the producers of \u201cSerial,\u201d he and journalist Sarah Koenig teamed up.",
        "Angry demonstrators clashed with police in Milwaukee on Saturday night after a police officer fatally shot a man who had a gun during a foot chase that turned deadly. The violence erupted on the city\u2019s predominantly black north side, an area beset with a history of violence and distrust between police and the community. During a midnight news conference, Mayor Tom Barrett stood beside city leaders to plead for an end to the chaos that had been unfolding for hours on city streets, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWe have to have calm,\u201d Barrett said.",
        "A massive study published this month in the Journal of Drug Issues found that the proportion of marijuana users who smoke daily has rapidly grown, and that many of those frequent users are poor and lack a diploma. Examining a decade of federal surveys of drug use conducted between 2002 and 2013, study authors Steven Davenport and Jonathan Caulkins paint one of the clearest pictures yet of the demographics of current marijuana use in the U. S.",
        "CHARLOTTE \u2014 Sara Edwards looked out on the sea of orange traffic barrels outside her pet shop, where the city is building a line, and offered the Maryland suburbs preparing for Purple Line construction some advice: \u201cGet ready,\u201d Edwards said, because travel will be \u201chorrendous\u201d for years. Down the road, Chris Pistolis, owner of South 21 Jr. restaurant, had a similar take on life along a construction site: \u201cIt\u2019s a traffic nightmare. \u201d \u201cBrace yourself,\u201d said Tiffany Wright, spokeswoman for AAA Carolinas. \u201cAnd if you live in the surrounding area, start looking for alternate routes.",
        "Donald Trump called Monday for a Cold mobilization against \u201cradical Islamic terror,\u201d repeating and repackaging calls for strict immigration controls \u2014 including a new ideological litmus test for Muslim visitors and migrants \u2014 and blaming the current level of worldwide terrorist attacks on President Obama and Hillary Clinton. In a grab bag of promises to battle the Islamic State organization together with Russia and anyone else who wants to join the fight, the Republican nominee underlined the need to improve intelligence and shut down militant propaganda, recruiting and financing.",
        "On Monday, Donald Trump gave a speech at Youngstown State University in which he offered some more detail to his foreign policy proposals. Included in those details was more about his announcement last December that the United States should bar Muslims from entering the United States \u201duntil our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d We\u2019ve excerpted the portion of his speech related to that proposal and are annotating it, below.

        "A week before the last U. S. soldiers left his country in December 2011, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri traveled to Washington to meet the team that would help shape Iraq\u2019s future once the troops and tanks were gone. Over dinner at the Blair House, guest quarters for elite White House visitors since the 1940s, the dour Iraqi sipped tea while Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke of how her department\u2019s civilian experts could help Iraqis avoid a return to terrorism and sectarian bloodshed.",
        "In campaign appearances for Donald Trump, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn has cast the presidential race as a continuation of the career he spent battling dangerous enemies in distant wars. \u201cThe enemy camp in this case is Hillary Rodham Clinton,\u201d he said at a rally in Florida this month, pointing his thumbs down in disgust. \u201cThis is a person who does not know the difference between a lie and the truth. . . . She is somebody who will leave Americans behind on the battlefield.",
        "Historic flooding in Louisiana forced thousands from their homes and left at least six people dead, authorities said, with officials warning that the flood\u2019s impact is far from over. \u201cObviously, this remains a very serious event \u2026 and it remains ongoing,\u201d Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) said during a news briefing late Sunday night. \u201cThis truly is a storm that has ravaged all of south Louisiana. \u201d More than 20, 000 people were rescued from their homes through Sunday night, Edwards said during the briefing.",
        "Southern Louisiana is under water after three days of rain. The historic and deadly flooding began to take shape Friday and continued through the weekend as wave after wave of moisture pummeled the Baton Rouge region. The disaster was caused by two features \u2014 extreme humidity and low pressure that hovered over the Gulf Coast for days. Precipitable water \u2014 a measure of how much moisture is in the air over a certain location \u2014 was off the charts.",

Before he even got to that point, the lasting image of Bolt\u2019s dominant night came in the semifinal heat, before he reached the finish line. [Bolt takes place among greatest athletes] You didn\u2019t even have to watch the race to know what happened.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Not long after Donald Trump delivered his acceptance speech at the festival of rage, hate, and megalomania otherwise known as the GOP convention, leading Never Trump conservatives despaired that the GOP\u2019s nomination of Trump could cost the party a generation of young voters. As former Jeb Bush adviser Tim Miller pointed out, the two conventions did not give the average any reason to be a Republican. Miller added: \u201cWe\u2019re giving away a generation. \u201d A new USA the Vote poll released today will not do much to assuage those fears.",
        "It\u2019s a classic social science experiment: Imagine you are walking along the train tracks when you spot a runaway train hurtling toward five unsuspecting track workers. Fortunately, there is a signal lever in front of you. If you pull it, you can divert the train to another track and save five people. Seems like an easy decision. Except for one problem: There is one unsuspecting worker on the other track. If you divert the train, you will be responsible for killing someone who would otherwise not be in danger. What do you do?",
        "On Sunday, Donald Trump\u2019s surrogates fanned out across the talk shows, falsely insisting that the campaign was on track. Trump is focused! Trump \u201cgets it\u201d! The race is \u201cnot over,\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) declared, which is a sure sign that a whole lot of people think it\u2019s over. For such an campaign, however, Trump is very angry that the media are conniving to make him lose.",
        "Dominick Bailey sat at his computer, scrutinizing the medication lists of patients in the geriatric unit. A doctor had prescribed blood pressure medication for a woman at a dose that could cause her to faint or fall. An woman hospitalized for knee surgery was taking several drugs that were not meant for older patients because of their severe potential side effects. And then there was Lola Cal. She had a long history of health problems, including high blood pressure and respiratory disease. She was in the hospital with pneumonia and had difficulty breathing.",
        "When he was three months old, Jeremy Shuler\u2019s parents were surprised to find he seemed to pay close attention to things for so long. Instead of the seconds they expected from an infant, he would watch closely for half an hour. And it seemed the things that fascinated him most were letters and numbers \u2014 they joked that he sat through a whole video to get to the credits. When he was 15 months old, Jeremy knew the alphabet and found letters and numbers everywhere \u2014 in his pasta, in clouds, in stars, in the patterns of marble tiles.",
        "LUCKNOW, INDIA \u2014 She was still a teenager when a pack of young men pulled her into a car, tortured her and her.

        "Donald Trump says he wants the news media to stop being crooked, dishonest and \u2014 his favorite word \u2014 rigged. What he really seems to want is for journalists to stop doing their jobs, which is to examine the backgrounds of candidates and hold them to the truth. As many reporters have toughened their questioning in recent weeks, and as his campaign has struggled under one disaster after other, the Republican nominee has squealed ever louder. Based on every complaint Trump has made, he doesn\u2019t understand what journalism\u2019s role in our democracy is supposed to be.",
        "There was a time in his political career when Rudy Giuliani talked about so much that Joe Biden famously said of him that there were \u201donly three things he mentions in a sentence: A noun, a verb and .\u201d But on Monday, while introducing Donald Trump and Mike Pence at a speech in Ohio, Giuliani almost seemed to forget the event that so defined his time as New York mayor. \u201dUnder those eight years before Obama came along, we didn\u2019t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States,\u201d he said.",
        "Both sides of Julian Pesina\u2019s double life were closing in on his secrets. Pesina was a police officer in Balcones Heights, a small city of 3, 000 people near San Antonio.

        "The news about \u201cThe Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore,\u201d which was canceled Monday by Comedy Central after an run, seems abrupt but hardly surprising. Both Wilmore and \u201cThe Daily Show\u2019s\u201d Trevor Noah were given the tasks of replacing Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart, who both moved on, in a to other work. The stakes couldn\u2019t possibly be higher in the race to outsmart, and outperform the antics of the 2016 campaign. \u201cThe Nightly Show\u201d was often funny, but it failed to become a habit, both on television and online.",

Skepticism of the alleged finding quickly overtook the initial enthusiasm. This week, we may finally find out whether the Nazi train has indeed been found. One year after claiming to have traced it, a team of 35 researchers that includes Piotr Koper and Andreas Richter will start digging for it Tuesday morning."
