        "Just over 100 hundred miles from Brazil\u2019s largest outbreak of the Zika virus sits a grouping of modest houses scattered on an arid, desolate landscape. Some show flashes of light pastel colors that jump out from hills, when seen in the distance. A look inside one of the homes reveals religious iconography along with few furnishings and dirt floors. [The Heart of the Zika outbreak] Religious items decorate the walls of a village home.",
        "The FBI on Tuesday forcefully defended its decision not to criminally charge Hillary Clinton in connection with her use of a private email server as secretary of state in a letter to lawmakers that laid out its rationale for refusing to do so. The letter was sent to House Oversight Committee lawmakers the same day that the bureau released to the Congress a variety of material from its investigation. It marked yet another occasion in which FBI leadership responded to \u2014 and in some cases, rebutted \u2014 GOP claims about why the Democratic presidential nominee should have been charged.",
        "John McLaughlin, a former Jesuit priest, speechwriter for President Richard M. Nixon and conservative provocateur whose pugnacious style as a host of a political chat show helped usher in the era of impolite punditry, died Aug. 16 at his home in Washington. He was 89. The cause was complications from prostate cancer, said journalist Eleanor Clift, one of his sparring partners. Mr. McLaughlin missed the most recent installment of his syndicated public affairs program, \u201cThe McLaughlin Group. \u201d For more than three decades, Mr.",
        "Kathleen Kane, once a rising star in Pennsylvania politics, said Tuesday that she will resign as the state\u2019s attorney general after she was found guilty of nine criminal charges, including two felony perjury counts. \u201cI have been honored to serve the people of Pennsylvania and I wish them health and safety in all their days,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement the afternoon after her conviction.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 They were strangers at the starting line, a Dartmouth graduate who barely qualified for these Olympics and an runner who transplanted to New Zealand seven years ago. Less than 20 minutes later, they found themselves eternally linked \u2014 by circumstance, by action, by benevolence. In a sport measured by a running clock and at a global event where only the victors are awarded shiny medals, the display of sportsmanship Tuesday morning resonated far beyond the track. \u201cThat girl is the Olympic spirit right there,\u201d New Zealand runner Nikki Hamblin said later.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Among the giggly sisterhood of the U. S. women\u2019s gymnastics team, everyone agrees that to finish second to Simone Biles is the same as finishing first.",
        "Once upon a time, a scantily clad lass padding down a beach might cause a riot \u2014 at least of eyeballs eager to extend a sidelong glance. Today, it\u2019s the fully clothed woman who overheats passions in France, where three towns have banned the burkini. Leave it to the French to criminalize modesty. Latest to the is the Corsican village of Sisco, where three Muslim families and a group of local teens reportedly got into a row this weekend when one of the Muslim men became upset as a tourist photographed his wife.",
        "Glenn Hutchins is of the Silver Lake technology investment firm and vice chairman of the Brookings Institution. This year\u2019s startling election poses a real risk of touching off an American Brexit. In other words, there is a meaningful chance that 2016 could begin a retreat of the United States from the mix of economic policies and the global engagement that U. S. businesses have regarded for decades as central to their success \u2014 unless business leaders can move decisively to redefine their goals as harmonious with those of and families.",
        "Steven Pearlstein is a business and economics writer at The Post and a public affairs professor at George Mason University. My colleague David Ignatius is right [\u201cWhen robots take all the jobs,\u201d Washington Forum, Aug. 12] that millions of jobs are threatened by things such as cars, voice recognition systems and intelligent software, in the same way that millions of jobs were eliminated by the mechanical reaper and precision lasers and computers. The result will certainly be a lot of economic churn and dislocation.",
        "The fight against the Islamic State may get the headlines. But it\u2019s the military threats from Russia and China that most worry top Pentagon officials \u2014 and are driving a new arms race to deter these rivals. This question of how to deal with Russian and Chinese military advances has gotten almost no attention in the 2016 presidential campaign. But it deserves a careful look.",
        "DONALD TRUMP\u2019S proposal to ban Muslims from the country has taken many forms over the past few months. All have been abhorrent. All, including the most recent iteration, would have a consequence that has so far gone ignored: the harm it would do to colleges and universities across the United States. In his acceptance speech at the Republican convention, Mr. Trump revised his original call for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d and instead suggested suspending immigration \u201cfrom any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.",
        "\u201cDEVASTATING AND overwhelming. \u201d Those are the conditions in the ancient and metropolis of Aleppo, according to the head of delegation for the International Committee of the Red Cross, Marianne Gasser, who was in the Syrian city recently. \u201cWe hear that dozens of civilians are being killed every day and scores more injured from shells, mortars and rockets,\u201d Ms. Gasser said. \u201cThe bombing is constant. The violence is threatening hundreds of thousands of people\u2019s lives, homes and livelihoods. \u201d War crimes appear to be also.",
        "Some of the most powerful espionage tools created by the National Security Agency\u2019s elite group of hackers have been revealed in recent days, a development that could pose severe consequences for the spy agency\u2019s operations and the security of government and corporate computers. A cache of hacking tools with code names such as Epicbanana, Buzzdirection and Egregiousblunder appeared mysteriously online over the weekend, setting the security world abuzz with speculation over whether the material was legitimate.",
        "This story has been updated. Aetna, the nation\u2019s third largest health insurer, announced Monday night the most significant departure yet from the marketplaces set up by President Obama\u2019s signature health care law. The company, citing $430 million in losses selling insurance to individuals since January of 2014, will slash its participation from 15 states to four next year. Aetna\u2019s exit comes amid a string of announcements that large insurers are losing money selling their plans in the marketplaces, raising doubts about the stability and future of the business.",
        "BATON ROUGE \u2014 The waters and the death toll continued to rise Tuesday in Louisiana, as flooding of historic levels swept anew into some communities and stubbornly lingered in hundreds more. The scope of the disaster was unprecedented, officials said. At least 40, 000 homes had been damaged, Louisiana\u2019s governor said, and 11 people have been killed since two feet of rain began falling Thursday night.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s most infamous defender of Islamist extremism was found guilty of eliciting support for the Islamic State, officials said Tuesday, marking what authorities described as a milestone in the British campaign to combat homegrown terrorism. The verdict against Anjem Choudary, 49, is the first major conviction against a man seen across Europe as a Pied Piper for young radicals and a cheerleader for the Islamic State.",
        "On the morning of one of the most important days in her career, Cecile Richards waited anxiously in her office at Planned Parenthood headquarters in Manhattan, texting furiously with friends across the country. A few minutes past 10 a. m. a message from her daughter flashed across the screen. A single word: Yay! \u201cThat was when I knew we\u2019d won,\u201d Richards says, recalling the moment when she learned of the decision in the biggest case to come before the Supreme Court in more than two decades.",
        "When the sheriff\u2019s deputy responded to the 911 call in an upscale Florida neighborhood Monday night, she found a shirtless, Austin Harrouff on top of a man he had just stabbed to death, \u201cbiting and removing pieces of the victim\u2019s face with his teeth,\u201d Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said. The deputy fired her taser at Harrouff. No effect. Other deputies arrived and punched and kicked the suspect. Nothing. Even a police dog\u2019s bite didn\u2019t deter Harrouff from biting the dead man\u2019s face. \u201cHe was exhibiting abnormal levels of strength,\u201d Snyder said at a Tuesday morning news conference.",
        "The specimen sat in alcohol at the bottom of an opaque plastic container. Its luxuriant black fur was dark and matted, its characteristic tail curled. David Fernandez peered at the critter, which he\u2019d spent the better part of the past year trying to track down, and hoped it was the real thing. Fernandez had worked on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea for 14 years, but he\u2019d never seen one of these animals in its entirety before. No scientist ever had. He lifted the specimen out of its container and snapped a photo with his phone.",
        "Vice President Biden received a cold welcome Tuesday in Belgrade, Serbia, as hundreds of ultranationalists marched through the city chanting \u201dVote for Trump!\u201d Biden was in Serbia in a bid to encourage the country\u2019s government to normalize relations with Kosovo, which split away from Serbia in 1999 and claimed independence in 2008. However, the embittered 2016 U. S. presidential race \u2014 and perhaps Biden\u2019s history of support for the NATO bombing of Serbia in the 1990s \u2014 prompted radicals onto the street.",
        "Donald Trump gave a major speech Monday focused on how he would deal with the threat posed by the Islamic State. The centerpiece of his speech was a plan for \u201dextreme vetting\u201d of people who want to enter the United States. The address contained few details, designed instead to make the case he will be tougher, stronger and more aggressive in dealing with the threat posed by Islamist terrorists than either President Obama or Hillary Clinton.",
        "CHUCKWALLA VALLEY, Calif. \u2014 Just after noon on a summer day, the 5. Desert Sunlight Solar Farm \u2014 the biggest of its kind erected on U. S. federal land \u2014 is proving why this desolate spot is such a good one for harnessing the sun\u2019s rays. With few clouds above, the seemingly endless array is churning out 551. 3 megawatts, or million watts, of electricity, more than enough to power 160, 000 homes some 175 miles west of here in Los Angeles.",
        "Donald Trump, following weeks of gnawing agitation over his advisers\u2019 attempts to temper his style, moved late Tuesday to overhaul his struggling campaign by rebuffing those efforts and elevating two longtime associates who have encouraged his combative populism. Stephen Bannon, a former banker who runs the influential conservative outlet Breitbart News and is known for his fiercely politics, has been named the Trump campaign\u2019s chief executive. Kellyanne Conway, a veteran Republican pollster who has been close to Trump for years, will assume the role of campaign manager.",
        "The latest in Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is rightly described as a move to \u201clet Trump be Trump. \u201d In reality, the sudden changes highlight the fact that a politician whose instincts appeared so sure during the Republican primaries has lost his way as a candidate. It remains questionable whether he can find the equilibrium and the discipline needed to turn his flailing campaign around. That probably is what is behind the shifts that were formally announced in a release the Trump team emailed at 5:38 a. m. Wednesday, hours after the Wall Street Journal first reported the news.",
        "Donald Trump reshuffled his presidential campaign late Tuesday, appointing two new leaders: Stephen Bannon, the former banker who runs the conservative outlet Breitbart News, and Kellyanne Conway, the veteran Republican pollster Trump initially hired to fix his image with women. \u201cI have known Steve and Kellyanne both for many years,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cThey are extremely capable, highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win. \u201d Conway\u2019s campaign ascent has been rapid. She became a senior adviser to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on July 1. Now she\u2019s the whole ship.",
        "A \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of material that the FBI delivered to Congress about the Hillary Clinton email investigation \u2014 including a summary of agents\u2019 interview with top aide Huma Abedin \u2014 appears to be unclassified, which means it could possibly be released to the public, according to a legislator whose staff had reviewed the documents. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Charles E. Grassley is calling for Senate officials to separate the classified from the unclassified documents in order to turn over as much information to the public as possible.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The silence couldn\u2019t have been louder. On the track, runners stay in their own lanes. Off it, they\u2019re even more careful. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about it,\u201d Britain\u2019s Lynsey Sharp said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to comment on that right now,\u201d Canadian runner Melissa Bishop offered. The women\u2019s race at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics is one of the most anticipated track and field events, fraught with mixed emotions and plenty of whispers.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 From his paddleboard rental tent at the far end of Ipanema Beach, Paulo Vitor Breves has ample opportunity to observe the beachgoing Olympic tourist in his new foreign habitat. Several distinct traits identify the gringo, he noted. Most foreigners pick up their trash instead of leaving it strewn in the sand. The women hide behind towels and awkwardly shimmy out of their bulky outer clothes. And that vast bottom half of the tourist swimsuit always comes as a shocker. \u201cTheir bikinis look like underpants,\u201d Breves said. The beaches of Rio are governed by intricate protocols.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Two U. S. Olympic swimmers were prevented from leaving Brazil on Wednesday night as differences emerged in their accounts of an armed robbery they said they endured last weekend. The U. S. Olympic Committee said Wednesday evening that swimmers Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz were removed from their return flight to the United States by Brazilian authorities. Early Thursday, the USOC released a statement indicating that Conger and Bentz were no longer being detained but were not yet free to leave the country.",
        "Meet Agatha Bednarczuk and Barbara Seixas, Brazil\u2019s fiercest female athletes. They\u2019re the two women who handed Kerri alongside her beach volleyball partner April Ross, her first Olympic loss on Tuesday to reach the gold medal match against Germany. \u201cWe needed that so bad,\u201d Brazilian fan Bernard Deixeira told Time magazine on Tuesday after Seixas and Bednarczuk, known solely by the first names in their home country, beat the Americans in straight sets ( )."
