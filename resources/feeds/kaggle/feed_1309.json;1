A new report from MacRumors cites noted Apple analyst Ming who says there will be three new iPad models in 2017 \u2014 including a iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is an interesting device, introduced last year as something more than a tablet, though a bit less than a laptop. What do you call such a thing?

Toomey convened a roundtable discussion with local law enforcement leaders here in Western Pennsylvania, he made no boasts about a big, beautiful wall, or rounding up illegal immigrants, or banning Muslims. Instead, Toomey asked questions and listened. He spoke softly and judiciously.
