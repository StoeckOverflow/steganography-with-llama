        "The more researchers learn about the Zika virus, the worse it seems. A growing body of research has established that the virus can cause severe birth defects \u2014 most notably microcephaly, a condition characterized by an abnormally small head and often incomplete brain development. The virus also has been linked to cases of syndrome in adults, a rare autoimmune disorder that can result in paralysis and even death. Now, in a study in mice, researchers have found evidence that suggests adult brain cells critical to learning and memory also might be susceptible to the Zika virus.",
        "The Great Recession and the subsequent recovery from it have deepened the wedge between the very wealthy and everyone else in America, plunging the poor deeper into debt and wiping out of the wealth held by families in the heart of the middle class. The wealthiest Americans, meanwhile, appear close to regaining all their losses over the same period, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
        "Chicago police officials have recommended firing seven officers for lying about the shooting death of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager whose 2014 killing helped spark intense protests and a federal investigation of the department. The decision comes after the city\u2019s inspector general delivered a report this week on the shooting that called for the officers to be fired. After receiving this report, police officials and outside attorneys reviewed it and agreed to recommend firing seven officers, Anthony Guglielmi, a police spokesman, said Thursday morning.",
        "The Trump campaign\u2019s concerted effort to pump up questions about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health using innuendo and unfounded speculation now includes an official diagnosis: dysphasia. A spokeswoman alleged Thursday that Clinton suffers from the language disorder, with which she has never been diagnosed. Katrina Pierson, whose command of the facts has been seriously called into question in recent weeks, appeared on MSNBC to answer questions about why the Trump campaign is going down this road, even as Clinton\u2019s doctors say she\u2019s healthy and that the conspiracy theories are bogus.",
        "Donald Trump said lots (and lots) of thing during his town hall with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity on Wednesday night. This one \u2014 Trump talking about Hillary Clinton \u2014 stood out to me: She is so protected. They are so protecting her. She hasn\u2019t had a news conference in, like, 250 days. It couldn\u2019t be that long since Clinton has talked to the press, I thought. So, I went to the tool that some guy named Philip Bump built to track how long it\u2019s been since Clinton faced the press. And this is what I found: Almost 258 days!",
        "For much of the past year, Donald Trump proved uniquely untouchable, a political force of such invulnerability that he even bragged about attracting voters after hypothetically shooting someone on Fifth Avenue. Hoping to strip away the Teflon Don\u2019s legendary confidence to reveal the fleshy mortal beneath the expensive suits and long ties, members of the anarchist collective INDECLINE decided they would showcase the aspirant president in the most humiliating way they could imagine: without his clothes.",
        "Larry Wilmore sipped a glass of wine at the desk of his \u201cNightly Show\u201d and reflected on his run on Comedy Central, which officially ends Thursday. \u201cWe started our show thinking all the good bad race stuff was done already, but apparently we were wrong,\u201d he told viewers Tuesday night. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve covered race from just about every angle you can think of.",
        "In the end, the vengeful billionaire got his wish. Gawker Media said Thursday it will close its always brash and sometimes lacerating news and gossip site, Gawker. com, next week, in a capitulation to legal troubles secretly engineered by a business tycoon who bore a grudge against it. Gawker was ostensibly brought low by an lawsuit by former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan over a sex tape of Hogan that Gawker posted in 2012.",
        "Photographs and text by Phyllis Dooney To tell this story, I decided to install camera obscuras and then capture a portrait. I wanted to visually represent the of public and private life. Camera obscura is the phenomenon of light that led to the invention of the camera and is astonishingly simple; light waves will travel through a hole and land on the opposite plain, in this case, the walls, upside down. To create them, I blacked out any windows and light sources, and cut a hole where the light could come through.",
        "KALASH VALLEY, Pakistan \u2014 Hidden up in the mountains near Pakistan\u2019s border with Afghanistan, the Kalash tribe loves homemade wine and whiskey, dances for days at colorful festivals, and practices a religion that holds that God has spirits and messengers who speak through nature. Long before the campaign of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, the villagers fretted over whether they needed walls or lists to protect them from their Muslim neighbors \u2014 ultimately deciding that the towering heights of the Hindu Kush would protect them. But over the past century, Muslims from Pakistan and Afghanistan began moving in.",
        "BATON ROUGE \u2014 When Hurricane Katrina leveled New Orleans, thousands of people left behind their ruined homes and took refuge here. They found new jobs and rebuilt their homes. Slowly, things started to feel normal again. But then a nameless storm brought unprecedented flooding to Baton Rouge and a wide swath of southern Louisiana over the last week. Countless Katrina survivors have been left, for a second time, with nothing.",
        "The latest in Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has jolted the Republican establishment out of denial to a new realization: Whatever happens to their nominee in November, Trumpism may well endure as a source of ferment in their party. Until this week, it had been possible for party elders to convince themselves that Trump might prove to be a passing storm in their ranks rather than a portent of climate change. But to their dismay, the party has now signaled that he intends to go for broke in the final stretch of the campaign.",
        "CHARLOTTE \u2014 Donald Trump on Thursday expressed regret over causing \u201cpersonal pain\u201d through words he has used \u201cin the heat of debate,\u201d an unexpected and uncharacteristic declaration of remorse for a candidate whose public persona is defined by his combative and bombastic style. Speaking during his first campaign rally since rebooting his campaign, the Republican presidential nominee sought to frame himself as a candidate who occasionally crosses boundaries in that pursuit. He also sought to contrast himself with his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, whom he accused of dishonesty and pandering.",
        "Cecilia \u201cCissy\u201d Marshall sinks into a red wingback chair in her Northern Virginia living room. All around her are memories of her late husband, Thurgood Marshall, the great litigator for the NAACP who helped win the landmark case that ended legal segregation in America\u2019s public schools. Visitors to the Smithsonian\u2019s new National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opens Sept. 24, will find Thurgood Marshall\u2019s image and words featured inside.",
        "Florida Gov. Rick Scott confirmed Friday that the Zika virus is being spread locally by mosquitoes in Miami Beach, a development that marks an expansion of the outbreak in South Florida and immediately prompted a new travel advisory by federal officials. \u201dWe believe we have a new area where local transmissions are occurring in Miami Beach,\u201d Scott said at a noon press conference. This area covers about 1. 5 square miles between 8th and 28th streets and between the beach and Intracoastal Waterway a stretch that encompasses the vibrant, densely packed South Beach tourist district.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home. You and your friends are invited to a dinner at which the hosts, though do their level best to put out a nice spread and show you hospitality. You yourself on their liquor, stagger around drunk and tear a picture off the wall, then unzip your fly and urinate in their bushes. The morning after, the best you can muster to your hosts is some vague, mumbled regret for being a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the party. Really? Here\u2019s a new slogan for the U. S.",
        "The U. S. women\u2019s water polo team has been an unstoppable force in Rio and won its second straight Olympic gold medal on Friday afternoon with a win over Italy. This is the first time that a women\u2019s water polo team has defended its Olympic gold medal. Team USA won silver at the 2008 Beijing Olympics before claiming gold in London. According to The Post\u2019s Adam Kilgore, the team won all six games in Rio by a point margin. The U. S. women\u2019s water polo team was a force.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t regret anything. \u201d \u201cSometimes in the heat of debate, and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don\u2019t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that. And believe it or not, I regret it. I do regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. \u201d The first statement was Donald Trump\u2019s unscripted response this month when asked whether he regretted attacking the parents of a slain soldier.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Last night, Donald Trump delivered a speech in which he spoke in soothing tones about the need to unify the country and expressed \u201cregret\u201d about any remarks that have caused \u201cpersonal pain,\u201d though he didn\u2019t specify which particular remarks he regrets. This led some commentators to suggest that another \u201cpivot\u201d is underway. This morning, Trump released his first general election ad, an ugly and dishonest production which shows he isn\u2019t changing a thing.",
        "The resignation of Paul Manafort as chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was, to appropriate a term popular among Marxists, overdetermined. He had already been shoved aside by the new team of Steve Bannon, the Goldman Sachs alumnus and head honcho of the Breitbart website, and Kellyanne Conway, the GOP pollster. And the more questions were raised about Manafort\u2019s dealings with Ukrainian politicians, the worse it was for Trump. But Manafort\u2019s departure should be the beginning of a series of inquiries, not the end of the story. Campaign are said to be insiders\u2019 sort of news.",
        "For some of us, the puzzle of this election is not why Donald Trump is doing so badly but why he is doing so well. Given his obvious lack of qualifications, his absurd proposals, his hypocrisy, his obnoxious rhetoric, his sheer incompetence as a candidate, why is he not down 10 points in every state? In other words, who are Trump\u2019s voters and why do they stick with him? Sometimes a good writer with a keen eye can provide more insight than a dozen polls. J. D.",
        "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli national soccer league begins its new season on Saturday. But one of the most significant developments of the upcoming year may have happened last month. On July 26, Israeli police arrested more than 50 members of La Familia, the official supporters\u2019 group for Beitar Jerusalem. Several were suspected of attacking with an ax and seriously wounding a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv in October.",
        "LAPLACE, La. \u2014 The first attempt to assess the scope of damage from the past week\u2019s historic flooding in Louisiana has produced staggering numbers. Approximately 280, 000 people live in the areas that flooded, according to an analysis released Friday by the Baton Rouge Area Chamber. In those areas are 110, 000 homes worth a combined $20. 7 billion and more than 7, 000 businesses \u2014 about one in every five businesses in the region \u2014 that together employ more than 73, 000 people.",
        "Eager students at the University of Virginia have for years begun their first weekend in Charlottesville with an rite of passage: a raucous gathering known as Block Party. Residents in houses along Wertland Street rolled kegs of beer into their kitchens, filled coolers with liquor concoctions, and waited for students to swarm. The partying sometimes came with a price, including arrests, school discipline and, last year, an alleged sexual assault involving two drunk athletes. This weekend, . administrators hope it will be different.",
        "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will not be required to testify in person about her use of a private email server as secretary of state but will have to answer questions in writing about the setup close to election day in November, a federal judge ruled in a civil lawsuit Friday. The decision by U. S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan removes a potential political headache for Clinton. Sitting for a videotaped deposition could have created a distracting spectacle for Clinton\u2019s campaign and prolonged discussion of her trustworthiness, an issue that has hurt her in polls.",
        "The New York Times\u2019 Amy Chozick has a great scoop today regarding Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices while she was secretary of state. Here\u2019s the crux: Pressed by the F. B. I. about her email practices at the State Department, Hillary Clinton told investigators that former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had advised her to use a personal email account . .. Separately, in a 2009 email exchange that also emerged during the F. B. I. questioning, Mrs. Clinton, who had already decided to use private email, asked Mr.",
        "Throughout this election season, many have seen Donald Trump\u2019s success as an expression of white woes. Trump gave voice to the economic struggles of poor white Americans, and his campaign themes aligned perfectly with the grievances of globalization\u2019s losers. He thrilled crowds with his promises to banish immigrants and snatch back jobs lost to trade and offshoring. Recent evidence seems to have complicated the argument. Though many Trump supporters are workers, they don\u2019t appear to be particularly downtrodden, at least not financially.",
        "The Navy SEAL who wrote a book detailing the secretive raid that killed leader Osama bin Laden must pay the federal government at least $6. 8 million under a deal reached Friday to avoid prosecution for not getting approval for the work. The deal had been expected, and was outlined in a decree filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va. It ends a nearly saga for Matthew Bissonnette that began with the publication of \u201cNo Easy Day: The Firsthand of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden\u201d one year after the raid.",
        "A federal court on Thursday dismissed a case of a transgender funeral home employee in Michigan who claimed she was fired because of her gender transition. Aimee Australia Stephens was hired by a funeral home in the Detroit area in 2007 under her legal name at the time, Anthony Stevens, according to court documents.",
        "There\u2019s a story they tell in barbecue lore about the legendary Schmidt family of Texas, and how it nearly fell apart over internal feuding, like meat off a succulent pork rib. It happened in Lockhart, the Barbecue Capital of Texas. (This is an actual designation that the state\u2019s House of Representatives approved the same year this all went down.) A power struggle erupted after the family patriarch Edgar \u201cSmitty\u201d Schmidt retired from Kreuz Market. And it culminated in half the family dragging out coals from the famed pits to start a rival joint half a mile down the road."
