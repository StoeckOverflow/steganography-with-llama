        "The political over the FBI handing documents about the Hillary Clinton email investigation to Congress is intensifying, with Republicans complaining the materials were turned over in such a way that assessing them is difficult and Democrats contending they should not have been given to legislators.

        "You don\u2019t have a true indie movement until people start to worry about it being corrupted. The worries are often legitimate and the corruptions inevitable, but the consequences aren\u2019t always negative. And so it went in the biggest indie movement of the World Wide Web\u2019s first 25 years: the rise of the blogosphere in the early aughts and the independent explosion that it spurred. A small piece of that is dying next week, when Gawker. com (of which I was the founding editor) goes dark and the network of sites it belongs to becomes part of Univision.",

        "Memes didn\u2019t begin with the Web, but you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking so. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term in his 1976 book, \u201cThe Selfish Gene,\u201d to describe something that already existed. A meme, from the Greek \u201cmimeme\u201d (to imitate) was \u201ca unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. \u201d This encompassed phenomena from Martin Luther\u2019s \u201c95 Theses\u201d to the famous graffiti drawing \u201cKilroy Was Here,\u201d which dates to the beginning of World War II.",

Carter was referring to a parasite that plagued 3. 5 million people across 21 African countries as recently as 1986.

Because there\u2019s a very good chance they will be huddled around their TVs, celebrating the extraordinary force that is Gord Downie. He is a man, and a musician. But in Canada, he is much more.

        "Last month, Donald Trump finally appeared to be on par with Hillary Clinton in fundraising \u2014 a sign that he would have the resources to compete with her on the ground and in the air in the last stretch of the White House contest.
