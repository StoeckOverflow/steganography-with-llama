        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 As Brazilians readied to dance out of the Olympic spotlight, squeezing soccer thrills into a zany 17 days of brilliant athletic performances and a decathlon of mishaps, the XXXI Olympiad and the first in South America staggered to the finish line in exhausted relief. In these Games, if a medal were to be had, it would be for not giving up.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The crowd inside Carioca Arena 2 chanted, \u201c !\u201d as two wrestling coaches refused to the leave the mat, one shirtless and one stripped to his underwear. Early Sunday afternoon, one of the most bizarre and controversial episodes in amateur wrestling memory unfolded at the end of a bronze medal match. It began with a shady call that further raised questions about fairness in Olympic wrestling officiating. It ended with Forca Nacional officials escorting two shirtless Mongolian coaches from the mat following a spontaneous strip show.",
        "NAIROBI \u2014 When he crossed the Olympics marathon finish line, Feyisa Lilesa put his hands above his head in an \u201dX.\u201d Most of those who watched Lilesa\u2019s spectacular silver medal performance didn\u2019t know what that meant \u2014 or just how dangerous a protest they were watching. Lilesa was protesting the Ethiopian government\u2019s killing of hundreds of the country\u2019s Oromo people \u2014 an ethnic majority that has long complained about being marginalized by the country\u2019s government. The group has held protests this year over plans to reallocate Oromo land. Many of those protests ended in bloodshed.",
        "An aging United States reduces the economy\u2019s growth \u2014 big time. That\u2019s the startling conclusion of a new academic study, and if it withstands scholarly scrutiny, it could transform our national political and economic debate. We\u2019ve known for decades, of course, that the retirement of the huge generation \u2014 coupled with low birthrates \u2014 would make the United States an older society. Similarly, we\u2019ve known that this would squeeze the federal budget. Social Security and Medicare spending would grow rapidly, intensifying pressures to cut other programs, raise taxes or accept large budget deficits. All this has come to pass.",
        "WINCHESTER, Va. Political arguments are rarely gentle or polite anymore, so it was a gift to see two Republicans who passionately disagree about what Donald Trump means for our nation hash out their differences with grace. Their exchange helps explain the mess Trump has made of his campaign. One clear indicator: Trump has handed Hillary Clinton a substantial lead in this former bulwark of conservatism.",
        "OREGON AND California attracted national notice this year as battlegrounds in the struggle for accessible contraceptive care. New laws in both states allow pharmacists to prescribe hormonal birth control to women directly. Yet the fight for increased access to contraception isn\u2019t being fought on the West Coast alone; it\u2019s also taking place on computer and smartphone screens all over the country.",
        "IN 2013, a man contacted the Baltimore police with a complaint. As described by a recent Justice Department report, he said he had been hospitalized after two officers slammed him to the ground during an unjustified arrest. What happened next was a travesty of justice by any normal standards but par for the course for Baltimore\u2019s police department. The case went uninvestigated for 13 months, shuttled between two commands and buried in the bureaucratic folds. An internal audit flagged it, at which point it languished four more months before being assigned to an internal affairs detective.",
        "MONDAY MARKS the 20th anniversary of the great domestic policy innovation of the Clinton administration: welfare reform. The federal cash assistance program for the poor was converted from an benefit to a one conditioned on work effort, paid for by fixed federal grants to the states (plus state dollars). Born amid fierce ideological controversy, welfare reform has grown to maturity amid equally intense scrutiny, with both supporters and critics mining the data for validation. It is not surprising, therefore, that think tanks and academics marked the landmark legislation\u2019s birthday with more studies supporting their points.",
        "Donald Trump \u2014 he who likes to fly home at night in the comfort of his own plane to sleep in the comfort of his own bed \u2014 is at it again on the question of Hillary Clinton\u2019s stamina, or alleged lack thereof. \u201cTo defeat crime and radical Islamic terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina,\u201d he said in Wisconsin. \u201cHillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have that strength and stamina.",
        "Shaun \u201cShizz\u201d Miller was desperate. Police had surrounded his residence in South Yarmouth, Mass. and were demanding that the alleged drug trafficker \u2014 a fugitive for months \u2014 come outside. Miller did exactly that, but not before slipping on a wrinkled, mask that added about a to the \u2019s face. It was a criminal Hail Mary, to be sure, and it worked \u2014 for a time. Police say Shaun Miller used this realistic mask to conceal his identity.",
        "UNNATURAL CAUSES SICK AND DYING IN AMERICA | Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. Read part one, part two, part three and part four. MCCREARY COUNTY, Ky. \u2014 She died alone in the middle of the night, and her body was swiftly autopsied, embalmed and carted 135 miles to a remote Kentucky county where she had been raised. There, Dan Ridener waited. The undertaker watched as the Cadillac Escalade pulled up and the corpse was wheeled inside.",
        "The message on the receipt rattled Sadie Karina Elledge, but it made her grandfather see red. Instead of leaving a gratuity on Monday, a couple eating at the Harrisonburg, Va. restaurant where Sadie works scrawled: \u201cWe only tip citizens. \u201d The dig was aimed at Sadie, 18, who was born in America but is of Honduran and Mexican descent. So, John Elledge took a photo of the receipt left for his granddaughter and posted it on Facebook. Beneath the photo he typed: \u201cYou are a complete and total piece of dung.",
        "Paul Manafort has now been on both ends of Donald Trump experience. In April, he was brought in as the adult in the room, the (sort of) establishment guy who was going to instill order in the controlled chaos of Trumpworld. This week he found himself cast out, playing the sacrificial lamb for Trump\u2019s flagging campaign. The trouble started early in the week for Manafort as Trump announced he was bringing on Breitbart News executive Stephen Bannon and elevating pollster KellyAnne Conway to campaign manager.",
        "In many Hispanic homes in the United States, Univision is a constant TV presence and a huge influence. \u201cThey wake up and go to bed without changing the channel,\u201d said the company\u2019s news and digital chief, Isaac Lee. According to Nielsen, it\u2019s the largest network in the world. Last week, though, Univision made news with a purchase far afield from that core: It bought Gawker Media\u2019s sites \u2014 not especially concerned with Latino culture and oriented toward a young audience that is glued not to TV sets but to smartphones. What\u2019s going on here?",
        "The two new members of the Backstreet Boys stomped on the gas pedal and sped out of the driveway. They were teenagers, who had just wrapped up a night of band practice at the house of the man who promised he was going to make them famous. Their car zoomed down an Orlando road \u2014 and that\u2019s when they saw the flashing lights of a police car. Howie Dorough and Brian Littrell started to panic.",
        "The once forbidding Arctic region, home to polar bears and seas, has melted enough that this summer it\u2019s open not only for shipping but tourism. The proof lies in the Crystal Serenity cruise, a luxury tour of the Arctic that promises to carry passengers through the storied Northwest Passage and across the roof of the world. The controversial cruise was scheduled to set sail Tuesday from Seward, Alaska, and dock 32 days later in New York City.",
        "A sports executive who was a major donor to the Clinton Foundation and whose firm paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars in consulting fees wanted help getting a visa for a British soccer player with a criminal past. The crown prince of Bahrain, whose government gave more than $50, 000 to the Clintons\u2019 charity and who participated in its glitzy annual conference, wanted a meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. U2 rocker and philanthropist Bono, also a regular at foundation events, wanted help broadcasting a live link to the International Space Station during concerts.",
        "Evan McAllister was 23 years old when he fought in the Iraqi city of Ramadi in 2006. He killed men and buried friends. Eight years later, he watched the same city fall to the Islamic State. To McAllister, a former Marine staff sergeant and scout sniper instructor, the war he fought was a harebrained mission planned by Republicans, by Democrats and, in the end, lost to \u2019s brutal successor.",
        "Rudy Giuliani is finally running the race against Hillary Clinton that he first contemplated some 17 years ago: a brutish bout under a spotlight. Only he\u2019s doing it at the behest of his longtime friend Donald Trump. The former New York City mayor, who nearly ran against Clinton for the Senate in 2000, has emerged this summer as one of Trump\u2019s most incendiary advocates and alter egos, channeling and feeding the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s pugnacious instincts and dark suspicions.",
        "If you\u2019ve spent any time in downtown Washington, you\u2019ve probably seen Wanda Witter. Shock white hair, a determined, unsmiling set to her mouth, jeans. She may have asked you for some change and probably didn\u2019t smile if you gave her some. This month you may have also been taken aback by the black eye and stitches across her face. For years, Witter bedded down for the night at 13th and G streets NW, on the concrete in her blue sleeping bag, pulled up tight to keep the rats and cockroaches out.",
        "U. S. swimmer Ryan Lochte\u2019s four commercial sponsors dropped the Olympic medal winner Monday in response to the incident eight days ago in which he falsely claimed he and three teammates had been held up by armed robbers at a Rio de Janeiro gas station. The decisions by Speedo, Ralph Lauren, Airweave and Gentle Hair Removal came after Lochte admitted to \u201c \u201d the claim, an assertion that overshadowed much of the second week of the Summer Olympics that concluded Sunday. Lochte, meanwhile, said he would continue to swim even if sanctioned by the U. S.",
        "NAIROBI \u2014 One day after winning silver in the Olympic marathon, Feyisa Lilesa faced a much different decision than other medalists: Would it be safe for him to return home? As he finished the race Sunday, Lilesa held his arms above his head in an \u201cX,\u201d a sign of protest used against the Ethiopian government for its persecution of the Oromo ethnic group. Lilesa took a brave stand, and at a news conference, it was clear he knew the price he might have to pay. \u201dIf I go back to Ethiopia, maybe they will kill me,\u201d he said Sunday.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m a journalist who interviews people who I disagree with all the time. \u201d \u2014 Sean Hannity, 2008 \u201cI never claimed to be a journalist. \u201d \u2014 Sean Hannity, 2016 *** Not since lawmakers diagnosed Terri Schaivo\u2019s condition from the Senate floor has there been such medical quackery in the political realm. Last week, Newsweek\u2019s Kurt Eichenwald reported that a letter attesting to Donald Trump\u2019s magnificent health (he \u201cwill be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d) was not from an internist but from a gastroenterologist. This belly doctor boasted that \u201cMr.",
        "Grading on a curve, Kellyanne Conway is doing work for Donald Trump. She hasn\u2019t manhandled a reporter as Corey Lewandowski did. She\u2019s not tied up with Russian oligarchs as Paul Manafort has been. But in absolute terms, her tenure has gotten off to a rocky start and her appearance on the Sunday shows was misguided if not . To recap Trump\u2019s travails since she came on: He made a condescending speech to African Americans that only magnified his cluelessness. He insisted on grandstanding in Baton Rouge, only to be told off by the governor and exclude the press anyway.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Has Donald Trump given up on winning the White House and \u201cpivoted\u201d (this might be his real pivot) to a effort to build a national following that will outlast the election, perhaps allowing him to establish a media empire with him at the helm \u2014 one that caters, at least to some degree, to a white nationalist or \u201c \u201d audience? Was that his plan all along?",
        "As a proud Latina, the daughter of two Cuban immigrants, who lives in a heavily Latino, neighborhood, the question I\u2019m asked all the time these days is: Wait, how is it you support Donald Trump? It\u2019s an occasionally amusing, sometimes tiresome, but never surprising line of inquiry. After all, among the many false narratives out there about Trump, the one pushed hardest is that he\u2019s at odds with Latinos. But, like much of that rhetoric, it\u2019s a deliberately simplistic assessment of the Latino electorate. And, for the record, yes \u2014 I strongly support Trump.",

Over the past few months of the election, In Theory will be asking policy experts to weigh in on the critical questions our presidential candidates should be addressing \u2014 but often aren\u2019t. This week we\u2019re discussing health insurance exchanges. The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010 with the intention of increasing the quality and affordability of health insurance and lowering the uninsured rate by expanding health insurance coverage, through a combination of mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges.",

        "Remember the \u201drecurring slope lineae?\u201d Nope? How about \u201dliquid water on Mars\u201d? That should ring a bell. In the fall, NASA scientists announced the strongest suggestion yet that the Red Planet may occasionally host patches of liquid water. These \u201drecurring slope lineae\u201d (RSL) appear seasonally, resembling streaks of damp sand, and contain perchlorate salts that usually get left behind when water evaporates. The observations, made using NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) didn\u2019t offer direct evidence of water.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 The boy burst into tears as police apprehended him after he was spotted nervously pacing up and down a street in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk. When they cut open the Barcelona soccer shirt he was wearing, they found a suicide belt. He was just 15, according to local officials. Footage broadcast Monday on Kurdish television stations showed the dramatic moments as security forces gingerly stripped him of his belt."
