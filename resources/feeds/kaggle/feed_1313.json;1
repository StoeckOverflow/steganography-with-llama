        "Those of you who tuned in to NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d on Sunday night may have noticed something a little unusual: a celebrity, on network television, sans makeup. Alicia Keys, one of Season 11\u2019s says she no longer wears makeup, a decision she described publicly in May: \u201cI don\u2019t want to cover up anymore. Not my face, not my mind, not my soul, not my thoughts, not my dreams, not my struggles, not my emotional growth. Nothing. \u201d Keys\u2019s bare, freckled face has garnered some attention before Sunday\u2019s preview of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d Season 11.",
        "Donald Trump escalated his feud with the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s \u201dMorning Joe\u201d Monday, repeating a rumor straight off Page Six that Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski are romantically involved. Some day, when things calm down, I\u2019ll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure girlfriend, @morningmika. Two clowns! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016 The New York Post\u2019s popular gossip page speculated in June that Scarborough and Brzezinski \u201dcould soon go public as a couple\u201d following Brzezinski\u2019s divorce from her husband of 23 years. Scarborough and his wife divorced in 2013.",
        "By suggesting that the Republican National Committee yank resources from Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Sen. Jeff Flake ( .) is pulling at one of the most important threads holding Trump\u2019s campaign chances together. And that\u2019s independent of the fact that a linchpin of Trump\u2019s efforts in a key swing state is a kid who isn\u2019t yet a teenager. We know that Donald Trump\u2019s most fervent base of support is among white men without a college degree. We know, too, that this is a group of voters that is less committed to turning out than other groups.",
        "Donald Trump was a changed man last week. He gave good speeches, sticking mostly to the the script. He expressed \u201dregret\u201d for unspecified things he has said in the past. He became the first politician to show up in Louisiana to draw attention to historic flooding there, heading to the state before President Obama had even announced a visit. But it\u2019s a new week. Before 9 a. m. on Monday, Trump was picking fights with cable news hosts and a top Hillary Clinton aide.",
        "LAST SUMMER, day after day, I called the Little Girl. And night after night, I wondered whether I would ever actually get to talk with her. The Little Girl \u2014 actually, the real woman who inspired the iconic \u201cPeanuts\u201d character \u2014 was Donna Johnson Wold. And she proved as elusive as Charlie Brown\u2019s dream crush. Then, last July, I finally spoke with Ms. Wold, who was warm, humble and utterly endearing, as well as reassuring that she had built a fulfilling and rewarding life. More than six decades ago, she had chosen her longtime firefighter husband over Charles M.",
        "For some time, scientists who focus on Antarctica have been watching the progression of a large crack in one of the world\u2019s great ice shelves \u2014 Larsen C, the most northern major ice shelf of the Antarctic peninsula and the fourth largest Antarctic ice shelf overall. Larsen C, according to the British Antarctic Survey, is \u201cslightly smaller than Scotland. \u201d It\u2019s called an ice \u201cshelf\u201d because the entirety of this area is covered by ice that is floating on top of deep ocean waters. The crack in Larsen C grew around 30 kilometers (18.",
        "The man accused of killing nine black parishioners in a historic Charleston, S. C. church last year \u201c \u201d online, absorbing violent white supremacist beliefs from the Internet, according to federal prosecutors. Rather than adopting such convictions \u201cthrough his personal associations or experiences with white supremacist groups or individuals or others,\u201d prosecutors said these viewpoints were from material found online and elsewhere. Dylann Roof, 22, could face a death sentence in the federal case against him as well as in the state\u2019s parallel case stemming from the shooting.",
        "When my father was 88 and the picture of health for his age, he taught me, an experienced physician, an unexpected lesson. We were discussing treatment options promoted by his physician and other doctors for an aortic aneurysm \u2014 a ballooned segment of blood vessel at risk for dangerous rupture in his abdomen.",
        "White Lives Matter staged a rally outside the NAACP\u2019s Houston headquarters on Sunday, sparking controversy and counterprotests in a city where racial tensions remain high after a string of recent incidents. Clutching Confederate flags, white supremacist signs and, in several cases, assault rifles, roughly 20 White Lives Matter members stood on the sidewalk of a historically black neighborhood to denounce the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.",
        "The price of entry to see Hillary Clinton on Sunday evening was $50, 000 per person, a sum that got you an al fresco meal of tomato and mozzarella salad, lobster, strawberry shortcake and an intimate conversation with the possible next president of the United States. \u201cIt was the easiest event I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d said Elaine Schuster, a longtime Clinton friend who hosted the soiree at her waterfront home on Cape Cod, Mass. \u201cEveryone wanted to come. \u201d Not everyone could, of course: Just 28 people joined Clinton for cocktails and dinner in Schuster\u2019s back yard.",
        "Donald Trump is rapidly trying to turn around his presidential campaign with a vigorous and at times strained effort to shed a label applied to him by a substantial portion of the electorate: racist. Guided by his new campaign leadership, the Republican nominee has ordered a strategy to court black and Latino voters and is mobilizing scores of minority figures to advocate publicly for his candidacy.",
        "EpiPen maker Mylan has become the new boogeyman of the pharmaceutical industry. Following complaints from consumers that the company had hiked the price of the emergency by $100 in recent months for no obvious reason, members of Congress are calling for an investigation. The price has increased 450 percent since 2004, when a dose cost $100 in today\u2019s dollars, to its current price of more than $600. Many consumers hadn\u2019t noticed the gradual rise in price, however, because the company often only added in 9 to 15 percent each time and insurance companies had made up the difference.",
        "SPRING GROVE, Pa. \u2014 The secluded compound sits behind a thicket of tall trees, tucked between a mossy pond and the Hickory Heights golf course in York County. Jim Shaw took over this plot just north of the Maryland border nearly 30 years ago, raising eight children in a white house a few hundred feet from his mysterious laboratory. His three sons, Jimmy, John and David have dug millions of earthworms out of the soil with their bare hands over the years, packaging them in green cloth bags to sell.",
        "BATON ROUGE \u2014 President Obama toured a neighborhood here Tuesday and urged Americans to rally behind residents, many of whom have complained in recent days of feeling forgotten. The floods that hit Baton Rouge killed 13 and have been described as the worst natural disaster in the United States since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. But the damage and suffering have not received as much news coverage as that crisis. \u201cSometimes, once the floodwaters pass, people\u2019s attention spans pass,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis is not a this is not a issue . . .",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Donald Trump is currently running an ad in four swing states that graphically depicts the southern border as being overrun by dark hordes. It flatly states that in Hillary Clinton\u2019s America, the borders will be \u201copen. \u201d And it promises a response from President Trump, which is illustrated with cops carefully scanning the border and images of helicopters patrolling for fleeing invaders.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cpivot,\u201d desperately hoped for by sane Republicans, was over before it began. He couldn\u2019t pretend to be inclusive and statesmanlike for two days in a row if his life depended on it. Anyone who doubts this should only consider Trump\u2019s idea of an appeal to African American voters: \u201cWhat do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose? You\u2019re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed.",
        "Millennial homeownership rates are way, way down. And believe it or not, that\u2019s probably a good thing. Across all age groups, the U. S. homeownership rate \u2014 at 62. 9 percent \u2014 has now fallen to its lowest level in more than five decades. Among younger Americans only, things look especially paltry. Homeownership rates among Americans under age 35 are barely more than half the national number, at just 34. 1 percent. This too is a record low and about a fifth below its peak from the years of the .",
        "\u201cWhat are you all thinking? !\u201d That\u2019s the question Wendy Sherman says she has been asked in her travels around the world since leaving her post as U. S. undersecretary of state for political affairs last October. Of course, the subject of the query is Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. And of particular concern is the potential of a President Trump in control of the U. S. nuclear arsenal.

        "Given the spectacle of this year\u2019s presidential race, it is easy to overlook the parallel drama in the world of central banking. But when the monetary priesthood gathers Thursday for its annual camp in Jackson Hole, Wyo. heretics will stalk the halls. The proper objective of a central bank is no longer a settled issue. For more than a third of a century \u2014 arguably, since Paul Volcker\u2019s appointment to the Federal Reserve chairmanship in 1979 \u2014 the central bank has focused on a single goal: to reduce and stabilize inflation.",
        "Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential nominee, favors alternative energy \u2014 and she leads by example. On Tuesday, she burned one of her own supporters. Stein, making an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington, took her campaign on an unexpected detour when she accused the famed leftist Noam Chomsky of being cowardly. The icon of the left, though a backer of Stein\u2019s, has said that the only \u201crational choice\u201d for voters is to support Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.",
        "A federal appeals court said Tuesday that eliminating extra days of early voting in Ohio did not infringe on the right of African Americans to vote, overturning a judge\u2019s order that would have restored those days in the swing state. Ohio previously had what was known as \u201cGolden Week,\u201d a period before Election Day when voters could register to vote and cast a ballot on the same day. An amendment passed in 2014 closed off this period, pushing back the start of early voting to the day after voter registration ended.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway compared Hillary Clinton\u2019s relationship with the truth to what she called former president Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201dcasual relationships with other women.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton is a bore who many voters think is not trustworthy and not honest,\u201d Conway said during an interview with British journalist Matt Frei for a documentary that debuts Tuesday night in the United Kingdom. \u201dHer husband\u2019s problem was that he had casual relationships with other women. Hillary\u2019s problem is she has a casual relationship with the truth.",
        "Donald Trump has been saying for months that Hillary Clinton lacks the \u201dstamina\u201d to be president. More recently, he has questioned whether the Democratic presidential nominee is \u201dall there.\u201d Those are pretty vague diagnoses, but the implications are clear: Clinton isn\u2019t healthy enough to lead the country. Although Trump has stopped short of naming a specific illness that supposedly afflicts his opponent, his spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, asserted last week that Clinton suffers from dysphasia, and Trump allies in the media have many other theories about what ails the former secretary of state. So many theories.",
        "Former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros has filed a lawsuit against the network, claiming that she was sexually harassed by Roger Ailes when he was network chairman and that Ailes\u2019s lieutenants punished her for her complaints. Tantaros is the second personality at Fox in the past two months to sue Ailes and others at the network for alleged harassment. Former \u201cFox and Friends\u201d host Gretchen Carlson filed a suit against Ailes in early July, prompting his departure from the network he founded and shaped into a dominant media organization.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 The landmark agreement that halted a torrent of migrants flowing from Turkey into Europe is nearing collapse in the wake of the failed Turkish coup and the subsequent nationwide crackdown. Turkish and European leaders are threatening to abandon the deal \u2014 the Europeans because they say they are worried about widespread human rights abuses, the Turks because of European reluctance to fulfill a promise to drop visa restrictions for Turkish nationals.",
        "BANGOR, Maine  \u201d The closing of one of the last two Howard Johnson restaurants in a couple of weeks will mark the end of its fried clam strips, ice cream and other menu staples that nourished baby boomers and leave the   restaurant chain teetering on the brink of extinction. The slice of roadside Americana will no longer be served up in Bangor after Sept. 6. For waitress Kathe Jewett, it s the only job she s held since starting work when the restaurant opened in 1966.",
        "Amazon. com is expected to release a cheaper music service exclusively for its Echo devices, according to a report from Recode. The service will cost substantially less than other subscription music services, at either $4 or $5 per month, Recode\u2019s Peter Kafka reports. Most monthly music subscriptions cost about $10 per month. Amazon declined to comment on the reports. Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos is also the owner of The Washington Post.

        "SIRTE, Libya \u2014 When the Islamic State\u2019s religious police arrived at his door, Ahmooda Abu Amood feared he would never see his family again. The two militants drove up in a beige vehicle, Abu Amood said, the kind used to transport anyone who broke the rules to an office to pay a fine, to get a whipping \u2014 or to jail. But the men didn\u2019t come to arrest him that cool February evening. They offered him a job.",
        "The National Labor Relations Board ruled Tuesday that graduate students who work as teaching and research assistants at private universities are school employees, clearing the way for them to join or form unions that administrators must recognize.

        "By the time the man arrived at the lung disease clinic in Manchester, England, it was almost too late. It was April 2014 and the had spent the past seven years finding it harder and harder to breathe. Once able to run 10 kilometers, he could now barely walk 20 meters. His lungs were operating at a third their proper capacity. Doctors were stumped. Five years earlier, the man had been diagnosed with a serious inflammation of the lungs, known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or HP."
