        "AMATRICE, Italy \u2014 In this ancient town laid waste in seconds, Sister Mariana Lleshi, 35, walked the streets in a daze. A patch of white gauze was taped to her forehead. Behind her stood the ruins of her convent \u2014 flattened by the 6. earthquake that slammed Italy\u2019s heartland on Wednesday. Twenty women \u2014 mostly nuns, and a few lay residents \u2014 went to bed there Tuesday. By late Wednesday, seven were still missing, part of a far larger tragedy unfolding in this Mediterranean nation. As rescuers searched the debris with dogs, a police officer nearby shook his head.",
        "Scientists have discovered what they believe to be a new planet, the closest one ever detected outside our solar system. It is a small, rocky planet not unlike our own, orbiting the sun\u2019s closest stellar neighbor. Astronomers have long suspected that the star Proxima Centauri could be home to a planet, but proof had been elusive. Dim red dwarf stars like Proxima have been found to host billions of small, closely orbiting planets throughout the galaxy.",
        "Doctors have long known that many breast cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy don\u2019t actually need it to prevent recurrence of the disease after surgery. But they haven\u2019t known exactly which patients might safely skip the toxic treatment. A European study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine sheds new light on the issue, concluding that many such patients might be able to avoid chemo. The key factor: Nearly half of the patients considered at high risk for recurrence might actually be low risk based on genetic factors, researchers found.",
        "The growing congressional scrutiny of pharmaceutical giant Mylan over the high cost of EpiPens could prove awkward for Sen. Joe Manchin. The West Virginia Democrat\u2019s daughter, Heather Bresch, is chief executive of the company, which appears to have hiked the price of the epinephrine by 400 percent since 2007. The device, which is used to treat severe allergic reactions, now costs more than $600 per dose. [U. S.",

        "WE ARE a little worried about Rudy Giuliani, the Republican former mayor of New York. Is \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d okay? During his speech at the GOP convention last month in Cleveland, it was notable that when he said Donald Trump loves \u201call people, from the top to the bottom,\u201d Mr. Giuliani animatedly gestured toward his knees as he said \u201ctop,\u201d and above his head as he said \u201cbottom. \u201d Also, why did he say that he and his wife, Judith, have been friends with Mr. Trump for 30 years, though he met his wife in 1999, only 17 years ago?",
        "In choosing Stephen Bannon to be the CEO of his campaign, Donald Trump has accomplished the extraordinary: He has found somebody as outrageous as he is. Bannon, who had been publisher of the website Breitbart, has called the pope a \u201ccommie\u201d and said Catholics are trying to boost Hispanic immigration because their \u201cchurch is dying. \u201d He called Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman who was shot in the head, a \u201chuman shield\u201d and the mayor of London a \u201cradical Muslim.",
        "The Associated Press reported yesterday: More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money  \u2014   either personally or through companies or groups  \u2014   to the Clinton Foundation.

        "How rich is it that the Republican presidential nominee with a fondness for taco bowls and fried chicken is questioning the health of his Democratic opponent? How insane is it that Donald Trump and his surrogates are running around a giant Internet grassy knoll to unearth photos of Hillary Clinton stumbling on stairs and being propped up by pillows to prove that the former secretary of state is crumbling in plain sight? Seriously, these folks need hobbies.",
        "Jonathan B. Jarvis is director of the National Park Service. In 1914, Stephen Mather, a wealthy director of a borax mining company in California, observed the deteriorating conditions of some of America\u2019s national parks and wrote a letter of protest to Interior Secretary Franklin Lane. Lane responded: \u201cDear Steve, if you don\u2019t like the way the parks are being run, come on down to Washington and run them yourself. \u201d Such challenges have launched many political careers in Washington, including my own.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkish troops and tanks crossed into Syria on Wednesday in support of a new U. S. offensive against the Islamic State, helping Syrian rebels to swiftly recapture an important border town but also adding another layer of complexity to Syria\u2019s deeply complicated war. By late afternoon, rebel units with the Free Syrian Army had swept into the center of the Syrian town of Jarabulus, the Islamic State\u2019s last foothold on the Turkish border. The rebels encountered almost no resistance from Islamic State fighters, who fled ahead of the advancing force, according to rebel commanders in the area.",

        "All is not well at Turing Pharmaceuticals. The company rose to notoriety last year when its famously defiant former chief executive, Martin Shkreli, defended inflating the price of a drug by more than 4, 000 percent. Now, a Turing Pharmaceuticals executive has filed a federal complaint, saying she faced retaliation after she complained of sexual harassment.

        "In early June, Donald Trump had some instructions for a small group of people assembled for a conference call. Over objections from Republican leaders, Trump urged the group to keep up the attacks on Gonzalo Curiel, the judge hearing two lawsuits alleging fraud at the defunct Trump University. The judge, Trump said, was biased because of his parents\u2019 Mexican heritage.

        "Jeff Sessions was Donald Trump\u2019s spirit animal on illegal immigration. Mother Jones last year labeled the senator from Alabama \u201dthe Right\u2019s Most Powerful Immigration Foe.\u201d He even worked against a GOP border security bill because it didn\u2019t include stricter deportation standards. \u201dA nation cannot control its borders if being caught violating those borders does not result in one\u2019s swift return home,\u201d Sessions said at the time. So Trump\u2019s apparent softening on mass deportation is a little awkward for Sessions.",

        "JACKSON, Miss. \u2014 Donald Trump touched down in this state Wednesday, returning to a region where he experienced an outburst of support that he has so far been unable to transfer to the battlegrounds up for grabs in November.

        "All politicians are actors. They must be, to travel the country telling the same personal anecdotes with the same emotional inflections, all while convincing constituents of their spontaneity and sincerity. When the public wants to know what politicians are really like in private, they either wait for a by the staff, or they wait for a fictionalized version that feels like it illuminates the truth as well as the facts would.

        "RENO, Nev. \u2014 The focus of the presidential contest turned Thursday to a blunt proposition: Do Donald Trump\u2019s views on race disqualify him from occupying the White House? Hillary Clinton made that very argument in a blistering speech here that recounted Trump\u2019s racially inflammatory remarks and policies and highlighted his support from the \u201c\u201d a conservative movement associated with white nationalism that the Democratic nominee called \u201can emerging racist ideology. \u201d [Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2018 \u2019 speech, annotated] \u201cTrump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters,\u201d Clinton said.",
        "For more than a year, Donald Trump took the hardest line on immigration \u2014 vowing to deport 11 million illegal immigrants en masse and pillorying his GOP primary rivals as favoring \u201camnesty. \u201d But 11 weeks before the election, Trump is suddenly sounding a lot like the opponents he repeatedly ridiculed.

        "On a Saturday morning the summer of 1994, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was unnerved as she stood at a podium outdoors in downtown Seattle. Hundreds of demonstrators had infiltrated the crowd at a rally for a White House plan to redesign the U. S. health care system, their messages ugly and personal. The first lady faced signs saying \u201cHeil Hillary,\u201d and she could barely hear her own voice over the boos. Sensing trouble, her Secret Service detail had, for the first time that day, persuaded Clinton to wear, under her crimson jacket, a bulletproof vest.",
        "Donald Trump has only been doing Fox News these days,* but on Wednesday night his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, gamely ventured into the unfriendly confines of Rachel Maddow\u2019s MSNBC show.
