        "Bernie Sanders never understood the epic quality of the Clinton scandals. In his first debate, he famously dismissed the email issue, it being beneath the dignity of a great revolutionary to deal in things so tawdry and straightforward. Sanders failed to understand that Clinton scandals are sprawling, complex things. They defy time and space. They grow and burrow. The central problem with Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails was not the classified material. It wasn\u2019t the charge by the FBI director of her extreme carelessness in handling it.",
        "SYDNEY To appreciate what\u2019s at stake for the world in this year\u2019s U. S. presidential election, it\u2019s useful to visit a place such as Australia that has been one of our most faithful allies \u2014 and that appears to be mortified at what\u2019s happening in American politics. Australians are polite, in their own rowdy way. And they know they have to live with whoever is elected president. So people here rarely criticize Donald Trump .",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s supporters can pretend otherwise, but deep down they must know the truth: Trump has been playing them for fools all along. All that bluster about creating a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to round up 11 million undocumented immigrants and kick them out of the country? Forget about it. Trump is now \u201csoftening\u201d that ridiculous pledge, which he never could have carried out, into a new policy in which \u201cwe work with them. \u201d Hmmm. Work with them how?",
        "Every four years, presidential candidates pledge to destroy the evil federal bureaucracy wreaking havoc on our small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs. Abolish the Environmental Protection Agency! Level the Labor Department! Eliminate Education, kill Commerce and eradicate Energy! It\u2019s true that the Obama administration has greatly expanded federal rulemaking. But if you talk with entrepreneurs, you\u2019ll learn that \u2014 with the major exception of our criminally convoluted tax system \u2014 the most burdensome barriers to their efforts often don\u2019t originate with the feds. They are, instead, constructed at the state and local levels. Think about it.",
        "Donald Trump is undergoing his own \u201cextreme vetting. \u201d And we are learning a great deal about the quality of his public pledges.",
        "Brazil police charged Ryan Lochte with a false crime report Thursday, stemming from the incident that took place during the Rio Olympics when he claimed that he and three other swimmers were robbed at gunpoint. If convicted, the decorated athlete could be given a sentence of one to six months in jail, according to Brazil\u2019s O Globo newspaper, although it is unlikely that he will ever return to that country. Authorities in Brazil said they will summon Lochte to appear in a court in that country and answer to the accusations against him.",
        "The University of Virginia has spent the past decade building an investment fund that now totals $2. 2 billion, a pile of money so large that officials say it could finance the entire school and medical center for nine months. As the balance grew, the university sought to protect the annual funding it gets from Virginia taxpayers and raised its tuition significantly, with the price for freshmen going up 30 percent since 2013.",
        "Iranian naval vessels veered close to American warships this week in a series of incidents that American officials described as harassing maneuvers risking dangerous escalation, defense officials said Thursday. The first incident occurred Tuesday, when Iranian ships made provocative maneuvers around a U. S. destroyer in the Strait of Hormuz, officials said. The following day, Iranian vessels came within several hundred meters of other American ships in the Persian Gulf, with one Iranian ship prompting the coastal patrol ship USS Squall to fire warning shots. \u201cThese were incidents that the crews deemed unsafe,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told reporters.",
        "ACCUMOLI, Italy \u2014 After toiling through the night, an army of 5, 000 rescue workers combed through mounds of hard rubble in a desperate search for new survivors Thursday following a devastating earthquake that may yet become Italy\u2019s deadliest in decades. A series of powerful aftershocks kept rocking the zone Thursday, with one strong afternoon tremor sending a dust cloud over the already flattened town of Amatrice. The shocks complicated rescue efforts as the death toll from Wednesday\u2019s quake rose to at least 250, according to the Civil Protection agency. An additional 270 people were being treated for injuries.",
        "After being blasted for price hikes on its lifesaving EpiPen allergy injections, the drugmaker Mylan announced Thursday that it will expand access to the product \u2014 not by lowering the price, but by creating a savings card that will cover up to $300 of its EpiPen . The list price of the drug is $609 for a of the injectors, up from less than $100 in 2007, according to data from Truven Health Analytics.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u201d Brazil s Senate began the impeachment trial of President Dilma Rousseff on Thursday and could permanently oust her as soon as next week. It s the latest crisis in a traumatic year in which the country has faced a Zika epidemic, a recession and controversies over the Olympic Games. But many here seem to have decided that Rousseff s fate is already a done deal. That makes her trial a much less attractive spectator sport than Olympic finals \u201d which on the closing weekend gave Brazil gold medals in men s soccer and volleyball.",
        "Two soccer suspensions involving speech were handed down Wednesday with vastly different penalties. One was for alleged insulting comments. The other was given to Hope Solo. We\u2019ll begin with the first case, which was overshadowed by the U. S. Soccer Federation\u2019s banishment of the infamous goalkeeper. [Solo is suspended six months, has contract terminated by U. S. Soccer] The United Soccer League, the third tier in the men\u2019s pro pyramid, suspended Orange County Blues midfielder Richard Chaplow for two matches and fined him an undisclosed amount for targeting an opponent with \u201coffensive and abusive language.",
        "The rocket exploded under the Army Humvee and launched the vehicle into the air. It was August 2005, two years into Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Darryl Lee Wright was on patrol with the Idaho National Guard in Kirkuk, a city in northern Iraq. Wright recalled later that he was \u201cviolently thrown and knocked unconscious from the percussion of the rocket\u2019s impact. \u201d The blast, he would say, was massive: \u201cRubble and debris from the impact showered the sky for scores of meters. \u201d The attack left Wright with stress disorder and a brain injury, he told federal agencies.",
        "When police were called early Wednesday to an apartment complex in Albuquerque, they thought they were responding to a domestic battery call. Instead, they saw the body of a girl, brutally killed. She had been drugged and sexually assaulted, police said. According to the Albuquerque Journal, she was killed hours before her 10th birthday party. The suspects: her mother, Michelle Martens; Martens\u2019s boyfriend, Fabian Gonzales; and Jessica Kelley.",

        "A federal judge ruled Friday that the University of North Carolina system cannot enforce the part of the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill\u201d that restricts which restrooms transgender people can use, a controversial provision that prompted boycotts, outrage and a Justice Department lawsuit. Until a final decision is reached in the case, the schools \u2014 which have said they are caught between conflicting state and federal mandates \u2014 cannot enforce the law\u2019s language ordering people to only use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificates, District Judge Thomas D. Schroeder wrote in an order issued Friday afternoon.",
        "On Dec. 29, 2014, Rep. Steve Scalise ( .) admitted that he\u2019d attended an event hosted by white supremacist leaders a decade earlier. The timing was awkward for Republicans, since Scalise had recently moved into the upper ranks of the House caucus after Eric Cantor lost his reelection bid. Within 24 hours, John A. Boehner stood by Scalise. \u201dMore than a decade ago, Representative Scalise made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate,\u201d Boehner said in a statement.",
        "AUGUSTA, Ga. \u201d They trickled into the night, a loss beginning their Friday night early. A catcher hung back. Matt Par\u00c3\u00a9 chatted with teammates and underwent a long treatment session as other Augusta GreenJackets players exited through a clubhouse door wedged open with a broken bat. He kept himself awake with a marathon shower. By the time Par\u00c3\u00a9 dressed, he had the clubhouse to himself, along with what was left of the GreenJackets postgame buffet. What have we got, Sarge? ?",
        "LEWISTON, Maine \u2014 With a fury that has become almost rote during his two terms in office, Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) has reignited a debate about race and crime in his state. Over 36 hours, he insisted that the vast majority of violent criminals were black or Hispanic, and blew up at a Democratic legislator whom he believed had \u2014 and who had not \u2014 accused him of racism.",
        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. Abraham Lincoln is said to have offered one of the sharpest, smartest defenses of the intelligence of a democratic people I\u2019ve ever seen: \u201cYou may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the time; but you can\u2019t fool all of the people all the time. \u201d In short, we\u2019re smarter together. But that\u2019s not what the Trumps think. Donald Trump\u2019s stance on presidential candidates has changed significantly over the years. Here\u2019s how.",
        "Shoppers have shaken off their caution: They\u2019re ponying up for appliances, taking a record number of summer airline trips and splurging on novelty items such as drones. Strong consumer spending is a bright spot in a recovering U. S. economy. But you wouldn\u2019t know any of this based on the performance of some of the biggest names in women\u2019s clothing. Anthropologie has posted four straight quarters of flat or declining \u201ccomparable sales,\u201d a measure of results on its website and in its stores open more than a year. J.",
        "Ed Henry once held an exalted position at Fox News. As a correspondent covering the Hillary Clinton campaign, he did his assigned job of badgering the candidate into taking questions. In fact, the Clinton traveling press corps could use a little Ed Henry right about now. That won\u2019t be happening, however. Whereas Henry\u2019s title was once chief White House correspondent, it\u2019s now chief national correspondent, a gig in which he won\u2019t be doing political reporting.",
        "My recent columns on Donald Trump have generated a consistent response from his supporters: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just admit that your lips are to Hillary\u2019s ass?\u201d \u201cKeep preaching to the Hillary choir. \u201d \u201cPlease notify me when you are going to write your column on the lies of Hillary Clinton. Oh, excuse me, that\u2019s not happening is it?\u201d \u201cIf . . . that lying psycho wins, there will be nothing left of this country.",
        "IN A democracy that prizes rule of law, calls to lock up public figures are jarring and usually out of place. But what to do if it\u2019s a public figure such as Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the crusading racial profiler of Maricopa County, Ariz. who has spent the past several years systematically flouting a federal judge\u2019s orders while hiding behind a smokescreen of obfuscation, manipulation and impunity?

        "The Air Force is investigating a report against a retired general who was on active duty at the time of the alleged incident, service officials said Friday. Details about the case are scant, but Col. Patrick Ryder, an Air Force spokesman, said the service will conduct a thorough investigation of Gen. Arthur J. Lichte, who retired as head of Air Mobility Command in 2009. Ryder declined to provide additional details, saying it would be inappropriate to do so.",
        "The American bombers came in several waves in the middle of the night. Hours earlier, Islamic State militants had used the Syrian village of Tokhar to launch mortar attacks at U. S. forces nearby. As the July 19 air raid began, dozens of people had gathered near a cluster of buildings on the northern edge of the village. U. S. warplanes had pounded Tokhar twice already in July. Just before 3 a. m. and aircraft bore down on the village again.",
        "GARDENDALE, ALA. \u2014 The school board in this small Birmingham suburb meets monthly, debates district policies and pays a superintendent\u2019s salary. But the Gardendale Board of Education oversees no schools, employs no teachers and enrolls no students. City officials in this predominantly white town appointed the board in 2014 as part of a effort to secede from surrounding Jefferson County \u2014 where there are more African American than white students \u2014 and form their own independent school system. Opponents argue that the secession effort is laced with racial overtones and amounts to a push for segregation.",
        "When it comes to media relations, Donald Trump has never been Mr. Congeniality \u2014 but he has been Mr. Accessibility. Throughout the primary season, he was omnipresent on cable news and granted interviews to journalists one might have expected him to avoid, such as former Bill Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. But lately the Republican presidential nominee has \u201dmostly retreated to the relatively cozy confines of Fox News,\u201d as the Huffington Post\u2019s Michael Calderone put it this week. Trump finally ventured out again Thursday night, appearing on CNN for the first time in more than two months.",
        "BROOKFIELD, Wis. \u2014 For a small group of undecided voters here, the presidential choices this year are bleak: Hillary Clinton is a \u201cliar\u201d with a lifetime of political skullduggery and a ruthless agenda for power, while Donald Trump is your \u201cdrunk uncle\u201d who can\u2019t be trusted to listen even to the good advice he\u2019s paying for.",
        "Drew Pinsky\u2019s HLN show, \u201cDr. Drew On Call,\u201d has been canceled by CNN, effective Sept. 22. In a statement, CNN executive vice president Ken Jautz said he and Pinsky \u201chave mutually agreed to air the final episode of his show on September 22\u2033 but gave no specific reason for the cancellation. CNN Money, in its reporting of the announcement, connected it to a broader shakeup at HLN, including the end of Nancy Grace\u2019s flamboyant show devoted to criminal court cases. But the decision came eight days after Pinsky\u2019s comments on a radio show on Aug."
