        "The Food and Drug Administration on Friday took the radical step of recommending that blood donations in all 50 states and U. S. territories be screened for the Zika virus. Such costly and testing is typically only done for the most dangerous infectious disease outbreaks and signals how seriously U. S. officials are taking the Zika threat. The announcement comes as the outbreak in Florida, the first state with local mosquito transmission of the virus, appears to be spreading. The initial cases were in or around Miami, but in recent days, Gov.",
        "It\u2019s just not as much fun being a Chinese Communist Party cadre any more. Largely gone now are the lavish banquets where you could while away the best part of a day in an orgy of food, booze and cigarettes. It\u2019s no longer politically correct to show ordinary people just how important you are by flaunting your expensive watches, luxury cars and mistresses. You don\u2019t get nearly as many gifts any more, and it\u2019s not wise to be known as someone whose business is conducted in karaoke parlors during massive drinking binges.",
        "kindergartners are entering school with stronger math and reading skills, narrowing the academic gap with their affluent peers and reversing a trend, according to research released Friday. The good news surprised researchers, who had expected to see gaps growing \u2014 particularly given the broad societal trends of increasing income inequality and economic segregation. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the lives of the rich and the poor have gotten more equal, so we thought the trend of the widening gap would continue,\u201d said Sean Reardon, a Stanford University professor of poverty and inequality in education.",
        "Jeffrey Hall was unequivocal about what he wanted. I want a white nation, ? he\u00c2 once\u00c2 told the Los Angeles Times. I don t hide what I am, and I don t water that down. ? An unemployed plumber who used to patrol\u00c2 the U. S. border looking for illegal immigrants, Hall was a\u00c2 rising star among white supremacists.

        "During roundup season, scenes in the Australian Outback are straight out of the dystopian action film \u201cMad Max. \u201d Where once the mustering of cattle was done on horseback, now it involves a horde of modified 4x4s, motorcycles and helicopters. This is how photographers Benjamin Rutherford and Josh Cunliffe experienced it as they captured the lifestyle for their project \u201cBushland. \u201d Because the rations and resources on the Queensland and New South Wales stations, or ranches, are reserved for workers, Rutherford and Cunliffe decided to also gain firsthand experience as ringers, the Australian term for cowboys.",
        "Interior Department Secretary Sally Jewell commemorated the U. S. National Park Service\u2019s 100 birthday in a speech late Thursday, calling their creation \u201cone of the nation\u2019s most revolutionary ideas \u2014 that these lands, our iconic historic sites and our culturally significant places should belong to every American.",
        "Hillary Clinton is methodically preparing for the presidential debates as a veteran lawyer would approach her biggest trial. She pores over briefing books thick with policy arcana and opposition research. She internalizes tips from the most seasoned debate coaches in her party. And she rehearses, over and over again, to perfect the pacing and substance of her presentation. Donald Trump is taking a different approach. He summons his informal band of counselors \u2014 including former New York mayor Rudolph W.",
        "Enrollment in the insurance exchanges for President Obama\u2019s signature law is at less than half the initial forecast, pushing several major insurance companies to stop offering health plans in certain markets because of significant financial losses. As a result, the administration\u2019s promise of a menu of choices has been replaced by a grim, though preliminary, forecast: Next year, more than 1 in 4 counties are at risk of having a single insurer on its exchange, said Cynthia Cox, who studies health reform for the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
        "HAVANA \u2014 In an era of frustrating, if not failed, U. S. policy interventions abroad, the Colombian peace deal announced last week offers the possibility of a rare victory for American diplomacy. It would be a validation of Plan Colombia, the U. S. counternarcotics and package that has sent roughly $10 billion to Bogota since 2000, tipping the government\u2019s fight against the Marxist FARC insurgents. The accord finalized Wednesday would convert the rebels from one of the world\u2019s most powerful groups to a legal political party with a sworn commitment to ending both the war and its narcotics trade.",
        "Secret Muslim. Socialist. Amateur. . Criminal. Throughout the presidency of Barack Obama, and even before it, a chorus of writers has stood stage right, reinterpreting the era but mainly eviscerating the man. Obama, initially little known, became a literary subgenre and publishing obsession, with countless volumes attacking the president, promising to unmask who he really is, what he really thinks and why he does the things he does. And for a while, at least, the books sold well. Selecting a representative set among dozens and dozens of titles in the Obama hatred literature is not easy.",
        "I followed news of the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting with one thing on my mind: Where was EMS? As Omar Mateen\u2019s assault played out, we now know, the 80 medics on the scene were kept more than 100 yards from the club, outside what\u2019s known as the \u201chot zone. \u201d Many of the injured were transported to hospitals in pickup trucks. The same was true during the Columbine school shooting in Littleton, Colo. in 1999, when crews waited outside nearly an hour for a SWAT team as a teacher lay dying.",
        "They operate heavy machinery. They Uber. They gush over the Olympics. Their friends are Bernie Sanders supporters. They\u2019re on the local baseball team. Yes, they want to make America great again, but Donald Trump\u2019s supporters contain multitudes. They are not, on the whole, the frothing Confederate fanatics baffled columnists have made them out to be. So who is Team Trump, really? We met up with locals waiting in line to attend a Trump rally in Altoona, Pa. where the population is 93. 8 percent white (as opposed to the national proportion of 77.",
        "It\u2019s a hot, steamy summer across much of the United States, and mosquito bites are as much a part of the season as backyard barbecues. This year, though, daily headlines remind us that a bite can bring more than an irritating itch. Mosquitoes are highly efficient machines. The outbreak of Zika virus in parts of Miami has put pregnant women there at risk. Mosquitoes can also transmit West Nile virus, dengue fever and chikungunya, another viral illness finding its way into the United States.",
        "KARKAMIS, Turkey \u2014 Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria is deepening tensions between two major U. S. groups, potentially setting up a conflict that could undermine Washington\u2019s efforts to eradicate the Islamic State\u2019s presence in Syria. A focal point of those animosities is the strategic Syrian town of Manbij, nestled on the western side of the Euphrates River. The Kurds wrested it from the Islamic State this month.

        "Syrian warplanes appeared to target a funeral Saturday morning in east Aleppo, killing dozens of civilians who had come to mourn the deaths of at least 13 people days earlier. The attack on Bab a Syrian suburb named after one of the city\u2019s ancient gates, took place in waves, activists said. The first barrel bomb hit a funeral procession, the second landed as rescue workers arrived. Doctors said the preliminary death count was 25. Aleppo is one of the Syrian war\u2019s most important battlegrounds, divided by government forces in the west and armed opposition groups in the east.",
        "The death of Nykea Aldridge on Friday afternoon is a death of the sort that\u2019s become sadly familiar in Chicago this summer. A young mother fatally shot on the street \u2014 this time accidentally, after hundreds of others that were intentional. What made Aldridge\u2019s death unusual is that she had a famous relative, Chicago Bulls guard Dwyane Wade. Wade tweeted about his cousin\u2019s death, in a call to address the gun violence that has plagued the city. My cousin was killed today in Chicago. Another act of senseless gun violence. 4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON. Unreal.",
        "DES MOINES \u2014 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sounded off forcefully on immigration policy and deportations Saturday, vowing to start removing undocumented criminals \u201cwithin one hour\u201d of taking office, but providing no indication how he would approach the millions of other undocumented immigrants living in the United States. \u201dWe are going to get rid of the criminals and it\u2019s going to happen within one hour after I take office, we start, okay?\u201d Trump said during a campaign event in Des Moines on Saturday. \u201dWe\u2019re going to bring them back where they came from.",

        "AMATRICE, Italy \u2014 This was once a quiet hilltop town in the rustic countryside of northern Lazio, relatively untouched for over 1, 000 years. Now, in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s devastating 6. earthquake, this medieval village is little more than a pile of rubble, already a memory. At least 291 people died across central Italy during and after the earthquake, and the body count may still rise in the days ahead.

        "During her first run for president in 2008, Hillary Clinton had an opportunity to become an undisputed leader in the gay rights movement. As she prepared for a forum on the Logo network, she reached out to her friend Hilary Rosen, a political consultant who is a lesbian. Rosen expressed frustration that so many mainstream political figures opposed legalized marriage, and she challenged Clinton to speak out for a community that had strongly supported her. Clinton refused. \u201cI\u2019m struggling with how we can support this with a religious and family context,\u2019\u2019 Rosen recalled Clinton telling her.",
        "Much has been made of Donald Trump\u2019s problems with a few voting groups \u2014 female voters, blacks and Hispanics, and young voters, in particular. And, to be sure, they are all problems. But relatively speaking, his biggest problem actually appears to be with a different group: Catholics. Yes, the man who once feuded with the pope (how soon we forget that actually happened) is cratering among Catholics. Back in 2012, GOP nominee Mitt Romney lost the Catholic vote by just 2 points, 50 percent to 48 percent.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s highly touted address on the \u201dalternative right\u201d sparked debates in every corner of American politics. For some commentators on the left, such as the historian Rick Perlstein, Clinton\u2019s decision to cleave \u201dmainstream\u201d conservatism from the alts was an unforced blunder. \u201dRepublican congressional candidates have to be tied to a Trumpism that is understood as the apotheosis of the recent history of the Republican Party,\u201d Perlstein wrote. \u201dBecause if they are not, it would be oh so easy for the survivors to say, on November 9: It ain\u2019t me, babe.
