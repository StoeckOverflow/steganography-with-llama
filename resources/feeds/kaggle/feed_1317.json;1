        "The presidential election could be crucial to the future of democracy, and not just in the United States. The global impact of a Donald Trump presidency would be disastrous. But even a Hillary Clinton win won\u2019t help reverse the worldwide retrenchment in democracy and human rights unless she brings a change in policy from the current administration. If all of that strikes you as a bit too breathless, consider what\u2019s happened over the past decade.",
        "U. S. experts and former officials secretly met several times with top North Korean officials this year, and some of them have emerged believing the regime of Kim Jong Un is ready to restart talks about its nuclear program. There has been no official dialogue between the U. S. government and North Korea since Kim assumed power following his father\u2019s death in 2011. But Pyongyang has quietly maintained contact with Washington through a series of \u201cTrack 2\u201d dialogues. Pyongyang often sends senior diplomats to attend these sessions.",
        "Not since Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 campaign has there been such widespread public disavowal by Republicans of their party\u2019s nominee. The Hillary Clinton Republicans will be one of the most important legacies of the 2016 campaigns. The question is whether they will constitute the forward end of a political realignment, or just a reaction to the unsuitability of Donald Trump for the presidency. Reasons for skepticism about change are rooted in the differences between today\u2019s polarized politics and the more tempered partisanship surrounding the elections of 1964 and 1980.",
        "Call it the Snooze Economy. Roughly two months before the presidential election, the economy has turned both boring and mystifying. It hardly impresses anyone, and yet this plodding performance is probably helping Hillary Clinton by minimizing bad economic news. More important: The lackluster expansion, if continued for a few more years, would represent an enormous achievement. It would finally erase most of the losses of the Great Recession. Of course, whether it will continue a few more years, or even through the election, are open questions.",
        "THE COMBINATION of President Obama\u2019s last months in office and the presidential campaign has unleashed a flurry of debate about nuclear weapons. Republican nominee Donald Trump has suggested he might withdraw the U. S. nuclear umbrella from allies such as Japan and South Korea, and his combative style has raised the specter of a hothead with his finger on the button. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama is considering whether to make a \u201cno first use\u201d declaration about nuclear weapons, and may seek renewed support for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty at the United Nations.",
        "FOR YEARS, the rules on unmanned aerial vehicles \u2014 also known as drones \u2014 have been irrational. Recreational drone users \u2014 ordinary people who buy quadcopters at Walmart and play around with them in their backyards \u2014 have been given broad freedom to pilot their flying devices. This seems to have resulted in increasingly large numbers of incidents reported by commercial airline pilots. Meanwhile, companies have been largely barred from using drones for all sorts of productive uses, from surveying storm damage to taking aerial photos to delivering packages. This bizarre situation will change on Monday.",
        "GAZIANTEP, Turkey \u2014 Clashes between Syrian rebels and forces, both backed by the United States, intensified Sunday in northern Syria, as the rebels seized villages from the Kurds and Turkish warplanes pounded Kurdish positions, killing dozens. The fresh fighting suggested that Turkey and its Syrian proxies are increasingly focused on stopping Kurdish forces from gaining more territory in northern Syria, particularly along Turkey\u2019s border, potentially signaling a widening of the conflict. And it threatens to divert resources and attention away from the campaign against the Islamic State.",
        "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 After a terrorist attack in Paris last year carried out in part by Islamist terrorists who masqueraded as migrants, Gov. Mike Pence directed all state agencies to halt the resettlement of Syrian refugees here in Indiana. Pence is now running on the Republican presidential ticket with Donald Trump, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims coming into the United States, halting immigration from unspecified countries and sending Syrian refugees back to their homeland. During the campaign, Pence has also boasted about his move to block refugees in his state.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s top allies and strategists sought Sunday to further distance the presidential hopeful from his call last year for a \u201ddeportation force\u201d to expel the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. But they left a key question unanswered: what Trump would do with the undocumented immigrants who have not committed other crimes in the United States. The question has taken on increased relevance in recent days, as Trump has appeared to soften the position he adopted during the Republican primary campaign as he looks to boost his appeal among moderate voters in the general election.",
        "In future elections, Republicans seeking office will have to answer an important question: Where did you stand on Donald Trump? Some seem acutely aware of this looming litmus test and are riding the fence (See: Ryan, Paul). Others are boldly offering what they hope will be the right answer. Ted Cruz, counting on a Trump defeat in November, has positioned himself as a principled holdout, apparently convinced that refusing to endorse his party\u2019s presidential nominee will boost his 2020 stock among Republican voters, who will realize they nominated the wrong candidate this time around."
