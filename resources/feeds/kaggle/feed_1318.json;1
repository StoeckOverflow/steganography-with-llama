        "It\u2019s always wise to have a Plan B. And because Plan A \u2014 the Oval Office \u2014 is looking less and less likely, Donald Trump surely has something else in mind. Will that something else be a new venture? As the candidate himself might phrase it, \u201ca lot of people think so. \u201d After all, Trump is good buddies with the recently deposed Roger Ailes, of Fox News, and just brought over Stephen Bannon, chairman of Breitbart News, to run his campaign.",

        "Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.

        "Immigrants and refugees are taking jobs from black workers. Undocumented criminals prey on American women. Muslims pose a threat to gay men and lesbians. For Donald Trump, appealing to minority groups and women often amounts to an \u201cus vs. them\u201d proposition \u2014 warning one group that it is being threatened or victimized by another, using exaggerated contrasts and a very broad brush.",
        "PHOENIX \u2014 After 30 years in the Senate, during which he transformed himself from war hero into political icon, John McCain now finds himself in more jeopardy than at any time during his political career. And for much of that, he can blame Donald Trump. This reelection campaign, his fifth, is forcing the Arizona Republican to do battle on multiple fronts, testing his political dexterity in ways unlike any of his previous races, including two unsuccessful bids for the presidency.",

        "A meditation on Anthony Weiner, upon the third iteration of a sexting scandal involving the former Democratic New York congressman and mayoral candidate. 1. It\u2019s a compulsion, isn\u2019t it? It must be. You know the old saying: Sext a strange woman once, then shame on you. Sext another woman later, then shame on you again. Sext yet another woman \u2014 once with your son in the frame, in images obtained by the New York Post \u2014 then check in with your therapist and admit that this really isn\u2019t funny anymore. 2.",
        "The Russians have just given us an August glimpse of a potential October surprise. We learned earlier this summer that widely believed to be tied to the Kremlin have broken into the email of the Democratic National Committee and others. The Post\u2019s Ellen Nakashima reported Monday night that Russian hackers have also been targeting state systems. And, in an apparent effort to boost Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy, they\u2019re leaking what they believe to be the most damaging documents at strategic points in the campaign. Last week, we learned something else: The Russians aren\u2019t just hackers \u2014 they\u2019re also hacks.",

        "THE MORNING PLUM: The Grand Trumpian Immigration Follies of 2016 are set to take another turn: Donald Trump has now announced that he will give a major speech (does any Trump speech fail to merit that label?) on the issue on Wednesday, in which he is expected to finally clarify his stance on mass deportations. Trump veep candidate Mike Pence promised yesterday that Trump would clarify it.

        "For months now, ordinary people, politicians and pundits have speculated in public and private: Is there, you know, something wrong with Donald Trump?

In the weeks leading up to the election, In Theory will be asking policy experts to weigh in on the critical questions our presidential candidates should be addressing \u2014 but often aren\u2019t. This week we\u2019re discussing the national debt. In the last fiscal year, the federal government spent 6 percent of its budget to service the national debt.

Seeking shelter from her many predators, the diminutive primate scurries up a tree for the night. Although she walks on two feet as we do, which sets her apart from earlier hominids, she has strong shoulders for climbing. But tonight, something goes wrong.

Bones shattered, she dies alone.",

A survey published Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics shows that more and more moms and dads are refusing the shots for their children. Much of the blame for this phenomenon can be attributed to continuing claims from everyone from actor Jim Carrey to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the link between vaccines and autism \u2014 an idea that originated with a paper later shown to be fraudulent and that numerous scientific teams have tested exhaustively and found to be untrue.",
