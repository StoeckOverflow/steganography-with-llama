        "The Islamic State reported the death of its chief spokesman, Abu Muhammad on Tuesday, potentially signaling the loss of a senior militant who has steered the group\u2019s campaign to bring violent operations to the West. If confirmed, Adnani\u2019s death would damage the Islamic State in two areas that have made the terrorist organization particularly dangerous: its sophisticated use of social media to reach a global audience and its willingness to employ the crudest forms of violence in scattered plots outside Iraq and Syria.",
        "GLOUCESTER, Va. \u2014 There was nothing remarkable about Gavin Grimm\u2019s first trip to the boys\u2019 bathroom at Gloucester High School. It was a little more than a month into his sophomore year, when the transgender teenager had begun quietly reintroducing himself to the student body as a boy. Grimm had used men\u2019s restrooms at restaurants, stores and the local amusement park, and using the boys\u2019 bathroom at his school felt like \u201cthe natural progression of things,\u201d he said. Just like cutting his hair short, just like wearing baggy pants and graphic just like beginning testosterone shots.",
        "Your dog gets you. I mean, he really gets you. No, really \u2014 he actually does. So say scientists in Hungary, who have published a groundbreaking study that found dogs understand both the meaning of words and the intonation used to speak them. Put simply: Even if you use a very excited tone of voice to tell the dog he\u2019s going to the vet, he\u2019ll probably see through you and be bummed about going.",
        "When Andrea Tantaros filed her Aug. 22 sexual harassment suit against Fox News and various top executives, she spared few colleagues. Defendants included the network itself, former chief Roger Ailes and four top executives. \u201cThe fish stinks from the head,\u201d alleges the complaint, citing a coterie of lieutenants who \u201ccondoned\u201d the alleged harassment by Ailes. Broadening out from there, the suit cited the names of various colleagues who were only remotely related to the charges at hand. For instance, the document alleges that Ailes gossiped with Tantaros about various Fox News personalities.",
        "Several leading Democratic lawmakers are asking the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate senior Trump campaign advisers for collusion in the suspected Russian hacking of American political organizations and election systems. \u00c2 It s the most serious set of allegations to date about deep connections between the Trump team and the Kremlin, though the case is largely circumstantial. On Monday, The New York Times broke the story of Senate Minority\u00c2 Leader Harry Reid s August 27 letter to FBI Director James Comey asking the bureau to investigate alleged Russian interference in the U. S.",
        "DONALD TRUMP\u2019S approach to immigration is a strategy that holds the promise of defusing an incendiary debate while recognizing political and labor market realities. Donald Trump\u2019s approach to immigration is a humanitarian and economic disaster that will sunder families, upend communities and subvert American workplaces and businesses. Take your pick. Mr. Trump certainly has. If it\u2019s Wednesday (or Friday, or Monday) it must be pivot day. Demanding consistency of Mr. Trump is like demanding it of the weather \u2014 an exercise in best left to the sanctimonious precincts of editorial pages.",
        "I know, it\u2019s tempting. But before we rush to gawk at sexting former congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s latest catastrophic embarrassment, and congratulate ourselves on our superior marriages and social media savvy, we might want to examine our own consciences a little more carefully. Our smugness about Weiner proves how quick we are to toss out our objections to invasions of online privacy and pry into other people\u2019s marriages when we have the opportunity to polish our and satisfy our own vulgar curiosity. Weiner\u2019s most recent happened just days after hackers launched their latest salvo against \u201cGhostbusters\u201d actress Leslie Jones.",
        "ST. LOUIS \u2014 Yellow tape marks the drinking fountains in 30 St. Louis Public Schools as denying students even a sip of water. In the wake of the crisis in Flint, Mich. this summer, officials here tested the water at their schools, many of them buildings in need of repair. Some, like Mann Elementary and Patrick Henry Downtown Academy, had results bad enough to necessitate an immediate of the drinking fountains; more than a dozen schools had at least one reading four or five times the readings recorded in Flint homes. The district shipped in bottled water.",
        "The Post reports: From the very start of his presidential campaign, Trump has shaped his message around who is to blame for America\u2019s problems \u2014 often pointing the finger at illegal immigrants, Black Lives Matter activists and other minorities in a pitch that was aimed primarily at white Republicans. But now, as Trump seeks to reach out to women and minorities who favor Democrat Hillary Clinton, the GOP nominee has increasingly taken to pitting one group against the other in a bid for support.",
        "The Chicago police superintendent on Tuesday recommended firing five police officers, including the officer who shot and killed Laquan McDonald, the black teenager whose death in 2014 continues to reverberate through the country\u2019s local police force. The move comes not long after Chicago police officials said they would recommend firing officers for lying about McDonald\u2019s death, agreeing with an inspector general\u2019s recommendations that they be dismissed. These officers had been relieved of policing powers this month after being accused of delivering false reports, according to the department.",
        "DeShawn Franklin was asleep in his bedroom when police officers, with their weapons drawn, barged in. He was punched several times, including three times in the face. He was also Tasered, dragged out of his bedroom, handcuffed and placed in a police car. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what was going on. I was just asleep,\u201d Franklin told The Washington Post. \u201cIt was just all a big shock and disturbance. \u201d One thing became clear immediately: Franklin, then an high school senior, had done nothing wrong.",
        "This post has been updated to include a reference to a second blackface cartoon by a different artist. After posting a cartoon Monday that depicts Hillary Clinton in blackface, pastor Mark Burns, a Donald Trump surrogate, quickly deleted the image from his Twitter account and apologized for spreading it. But the cartoonist who drew it, Tony Branco, is standing by his caricature. \u201dPolitical cartoons are supposed to rile people up, get people talking, have a discussion about issues,\u201d Branco told me. \u201dIt\u2019s supposed to focus people\u2019s attention on the issue, and that\u2019s what the cartoon did.",
        "Trivia fans: What do the performers of \u201cGypsys, Tramps & Thieves,\u201d \u201cEvergreen\u201d and \u201cI Feel the Earth Move\u201d have in common? Two things: All three scored No. 1 hits in the 1970s. And about four decades later, the three women \u2014 Cher, Barbra Streisand and Carole King \u2014 have composed fundraising pitches on behalf of Hillary Clinton and fellow Democrats. On Tuesday, King put forward the latest solicitation, asking donors to help elect Democrats to the U. S. House so that \u201cHillary\u2019s presidency lives up to its potential.",
        "During the Olympics in Rio a couple of weeks ago, Army Reserve 2nd Lt. Sam Kendricks was sprinting intently in the middle of his pole vaulting attempt when he heard the national anthem playing. He immediately dropped his pole and stood at attention, a spontaneous expression of heartfelt patriotism that elicited more praise than his eventual bronze medal. Last Friday, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick chose not to stand with his teammates during the national anthem.",
        "Authorities in Florida on Tuesday released a handful of 911 calls about the shooting inside Pulse nightclub in Orlando, making public for the first time recordings of what police were told about the attack while it was happening. In the calls, a series of increasingly distraught callers can be heard alerting police to the shooting and warning of injured friends and relatives who were trapped at the venue.",
        "Norman Early III pulled up to the Southern California house one night in September 2015 and sent a Snapchat message to the woman he went there to see, saying he was parked a short distance away. The two, who had known each other for several years, had crossed the line between friendship and flirtation while her husband was serving overseas. The woman responded, \u201cCome in the door is unlocked. \u201d [A Marine fights to prove he\u2019s innocent of sexual misconduct. Then a lost cellphone is found] The account from court documents reads like the start of slasher movie.",
        "President Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentences for 111 inmates, the latest in his push to ease harsh penalties given to nonviolent drug offenders. Obama has been critical of what he has called the \u201cdevastating\u201d effects of severe sentences handed down during the country\u2019s war on drugs. He became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison, and spoke there about the importance of \u201csecond chances. \u201d While the pace of commutations he granted had worried activists earlier this year, Obama has made a push in August to give clemency to scores of additional inmates.",
        "The FBI thinks that Lyle Jeffs, the polygamist religious leader accused in a food stamp scheme, disappeared from house arrest this summer by coating his ankle monitor in olive oil and sliding it off. That explanation may fly with nonbelievers, but in court documents filed last week, Jeffs\u2019s attorney has put forth a divine reason for his disappearance \u2014 the miracle of rapture: As this Court is well aware, Mr. Jeffs is currently not available to inform his counsel whether or not he agrees to the Continuance.",
        "Updated with Solo\u2019s decision not to play professionally again this season Hope Solo reacted the way any elite athlete would to news she had been suspended for six months and her contract terminated by the U. S. Soccer Federation in the wake of calling the Swedish team \u201ca bunch of cowards\u201d after the U. S. women\u2019s national team was eliminated from the Rio Olympics. She cursed. She hugged her husband. She broke down. This being Solo, the moment on Aug.",
        "Los Angeles police said they arrested singer Chris Brown on Tuesday evening on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. The felony charge stems from an incident, when a woman called 911 from outside Brown\u2019s residence, saying that she needed help, LAPD spokesman Tony Im said. Brown was arrested without incident at his house about 5 p. m. Im said. He said he could not confirm the weapon Brown allegedly used. He has not been booked in jail. The singer\u2019s arrest came after an standoff with police, who were awaiting a judge\u2019s approval for a search warrant.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 U. S. presidential candidate Donald Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto here Wednesday afternoon, marking Trump\u2019s first formal international trip as the Republican nominee, to a country where he is broadly despised for his vilification of illegal immigrants. Addressing the media after the meeting alongside Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump said the two discussed trade, illegal immigration, and border security \u2014 issues where their views do not align. \u201cI was straighforward in presenting my view on the impact of current trade and immigration policies on the Untied States,\u201d said Trump, who spoke second.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Side by side, a lone Mexican flag behind them, the men stood, one of the most unlikely political pairs imaginable. Donald Trump, the Republican nominee who has built his campaign around blaming Mexicans for the loss of American jobs and safety; and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the unpopular Mexican leader who stunned his country, and even members of his government, by extending an invitation to Trump for a visit. In the end, neither man chose to fuel the shouting match that Trump\u2019s campaign launched a year ago \u2014 a result that probably favored Trump.",
        "The Supreme Court will not allow North Carolina in the November election to use its strict voting law that a lower court found was enacted \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d to blunt the influence of African American voters. An evenly divided court said Wednesday that it would not restore the law that a unanimous panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found unconstitutional. The court\u2019s short order did not give the justices\u2019 reasoning. It was not a ruling on the merits of the law but instead on an emergency stay request filed by Gov.",
        "Scientists probing a newly exposed, formerly outcropping in Greenland claim they have discovered the oldest fossils ever seen, the remnants of microbial mats that lived 3. 7 billion years ago. It\u2019s a stunning announcement in a scientific field that is always contentious. But if confirmed, this would push the established fossil record more than 200 million years deeper into the Earth\u2019s early history, and provide support for the view that life appeared very soon after the Earth formed and may be commonplace throughout the universe.",
        "BRASILIA \u2014 President Dilma Rousseff was stripped of her office Wednesday in the culmination of a political crisis that has left Latin America\u2019s largest nation adrift, with an economy in deep recession and a public sharply divided over the country\u2019s future. Rousseff was impeached on arcane charges having to do with violating budget laws. But she was swept up in a tide of revulsion against Brazil\u2019s political class as the economy contracted and political parties were tarred by a massive corruption scandal.",
        "Only the naive have ever believed that democracy is solely a noble contest over competing ideas, proposals and solutions. Emotion looms large in every human decision, including how we cast our ballots, and smart politicians have always blended appeals to the heart and the gut with their entreaties to reason. We cherish what might be called the approach to politics, inspired by the 1858 debates between Honest Abe and \u201cThe Little Giant,\u201d Stephen Douglas, when the two candidates went from place to place in Illinois arguing with great eloquence about the future of slavery.",
        "Because laws are among the laws from which Washington feels exempt, the titles of congressional legislation often take liberties with the facts (e. g. the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). The Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act, however, precisely names the ailment for which it is the remedy. The Justice Department has negotiated bank settlement agreements ? whereby banks make restitution to the government for the damage they allegedly did in connection with the creation and sale of residential securities in the subprime mortgage crisis. Our subject here is not, however, whether the sums extracted from the banks (e.",
        "A new Washington News poll out today has some seemingly chilling numbers for Hillary Clinton. I think it\u2019s probably an outlier, because when you see a dramatic shift in one poll without much practical explanation, and other polls aren\u2019t yet showing the same thing, chances are it\u2019s an anomaly. Even the best polls, of which ours is one, produce outliers sometimes \u2014 that\u2019s just the nature of sampling.",
        "Some articles seem like they\u2019re trying too hard to be parodied. Dan Bacon\u2019s \u201cHow to Talk to a Woman Who is Wearing Headphones\u201d on TheModernMan. com is one of them. It is a truth universally acknowledged that a woman in headphones is NOT in want of a conversation \u2014 least of all with the kind of guy enough to take his cue from an article called \u201cHow to Talk to a Woman Who is Wearing Headphones\u201d from The Modern Man. com.",
        "When Donald Trump says he has a great relationship with \u201cthe Blacks,\u201d I wonder if he also gets along well with the Smiths. We know he\u2019s tight with the Whites. But what\u2019s with the definite article? During a brief dalliance with Google, I learned that Trump has used \u201cthe\u201d before whites at least once \u2014 when commenting that Black Entertainment Television doesn\u2019t offer awards to \u201cthe whites. \u201d But for the most part, he reserves \u201cthe\u201d for \u201cthe blacks,\u201d or, as most people would say, \u201cblacks,\u201d if they don\u2019t say \u201cAfrican Americans."
