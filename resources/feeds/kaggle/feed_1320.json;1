        "Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) crushed his primary opposition, winning 72 percent of the vote in Florida on Tuesday. Sen. John McCain ( .) also won his primary, 52 percent to 39 percent. (In 2010, he beat J. D. Hayworth by a 56 percent to 32 percent margin.) McCain\u2019s race, many in the press seemed to believe, was going to be a \u201csqueaker. \u201d It wasn\u2019t. It was one more rotten day for the crowd. Both McCain and Rubio were members of the Gang of Eight. Both support a path to citizenship.",
        "Thousands of employees who review patents for the federal government cheated taxpayers out of at least $18. 3 million as they billed the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office for almost 300, 000 hours they never worked, according to a new investigation by the agency\u2019s watchdog. The report released Wednesday determined that the full scale of fraud is probably double those numbers. Investigators said they interpreted the data they gathered conservatively, often giving employees the benefit of the doubt for the time they reportedly worked.",
        "At 2 p. m. the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Hermine. This post has been updated. Tropical Storm Hermine is forecast to hit Florida\u2019s vulnerable Big Bend area on Thursday. A storm surge is the biggest threat to the coast, while heavy rain and flooding will inundate inland areas. Isolated tornadoes are also possible as the storm comes ashore.

        "Hillary Clinton hit her stride after the Democratic National Convention, riding to a lead over Donald Trump in some national and polls \u2014 her highest of the year. As of today, though, Americans\u2019 views of her just hit a record low. A new Washington News poll shows 41 percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Clinton, while 56 percent have an unfavorable one. That\u2019s the worst image Clinton has had in her in national public life.",
        "The video is filled with lewd innuendoes, sly suggestions and incessant repetition of the number 69. It\u2019s narrated by a young woman and man who keep saying things like \u201cinsert\u201d and \u201con top\u201d and \u201cniiice. \u201d They\u2019re not talking about sex.

        "As tensions grow amid police shootings of young black men and a presidential campaign rife with allegations of racism, many people are calling for a more honest conversation about race in America. One pastor in Sunnyvale, Calif. is offering a venue to get people talking: Racists Anonymous. With the familiar backdrop of a program \u2014 folding chairs, burned coffee, the Serenity Prayer \u2014 people can explore the often uncharted terrain of their own feelings about race, said Ron Buford, pastor of the Congregational Community Church in Sunnyvale.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 Russia claimed Wednesday that it killed one of the Islamic State\u2019s most senior leaders with an airstrike in Syria, but U. S. officials said they had no evidence to back Moscow\u2019s account and were examining whether the militant was hit in an American strike. A statement from Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry cited \u201cintelligence channels\u201d confirming that Tuesday\u2019s attack near Aleppo killed Abu Muhammad the Islamic State\u2019s main spokesman and a leading strategist involved in planning attacks overseas.",

It was just after 7 a. m. when the mother of three cruised through an intersection and a man in a vehicle ran a red light, slamming into the driver\u2019s side of Pearl\u2019s Ford Taurus, police reports would later say.",
        "In a study published this week in Science and devoured by dog lovers worldwide, researchers at the Family Dog Project in Hungary concluded that pooches can understand the meaning and tone of human speech and that they process language in the same way humans do. To figure this out, the scientists analyzed scans of dogs\u2019 brain activity when hearing words. And to get those scans, they needed their subjects \u2014 13 family pets \u2014 to lie completely motionless in an fMRI scanner for eight whole minutes while wearing earphones and a radiofrequency coil on their heads.

        "The Badlands in South Dakota are a sacred site for the Oglala Lakota. (Carlotta Red Road Project) There are two portrayals of the Native American experience in the media, says photographer Carlotta Cardana. \u201c[The media covers] a lot of issues like violence, addiction and poverty. And then the other side is the hippie version of the exotic Native American connected to nature who can talk to trees and the wind,\u201d she said. So Cardana and writer Danielle SeeWalker set out to change that.",
        "Just over a year ago, Allegiant Air pilot Jason Kinzer was sitting in the cockpit of a McDonnell Douglas aircraft bound for Hagerstown, Md. having just taken off from St. Petersburg, Fla. As the plane climbed through 2, 500 feet, a cabin attendant alerted Kinzer to a strong burning smell. Alarmed, Kinzer turned Allegiant Air Flight 864 back toward the airport. Fire and rescue crews met the plane on the runway as smoke wafted from an engine. Kinzer told the 144 passengers to disembark. He then helped a flight attendant carry a paraplegic passenger to the exit.",
        "PHOENIX \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s latest immigration proposals would require a dramatic and costly expansion of the U. S. system \u2014 targeting millions more people for immediate removal while also making it much harder for millions of others to enter the country legally. The deportation priorities outlined by the Republican presidential nominee during a policy address here late Wednesday would target at least 5 million and as many as 6. 5 million undocumented immigrants for swift removal, or about half of the 11 million estimated to be living in the United States.",
        "John Rakolta Jr. was skeptical as he headed to a private meeting with Donald Trump in July at Chicago\u2019s Trump International Hotel. The Michigan construction executive, a longtime ally of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and a top fundraiser for Sen. Marco Rubio, was not yet sold on raising funds for Trump. But the Trump who Rakolta encountered in a suite on the 27th floor was nothing like the provocateur he expected. \u201cHe is extremely \u201d Rakolta said. \u201cNone of the stuff that I imagined.",

The National Hurricane Center announced on Thursday afternoon that Hermine, previously a tropical storm, attained hurricane intensity at 2:55 p. m. Eastern Thursday. At the same time, radar imagery revealed an eye emerging at the center of the storm, a telltale indicator that a hurricane was developing. Intense bands of wind and rain were already lashing Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast from Tampa to Panama City. Florida has not experienced hurricane conditions since 2005 during Hurricane Wilma.",
        "\u201cLast week, you could tell, there was the real possibility of a pivot. I think there was a big fight within the campaign, and I think the restrictionist forces won. \u201d Those words come from Alfonso Aguilar, a leading Latino conservative. Until yesterday, Aguilar was a prominent surrogate for Trump. But Trump delivered a hardline speech on immigration last night, and now top Latino supporters like Aguilar are bolting.",
        "Donald Trump s ungainly on immigration has a parallel in Britain, which is struggling to make sense of its own impetuous resolution to take control of its borders. Indeed, if Britain after the Brexit referendum is anything to go by, a Trump presidency would be dominated by zigzagging: sometimes to dilute past promises, sometimes to double down. In the terrifying event that Trump actually became president, you d hear supporters grumbling bitterly about treachery \u201d even as critics wondered furiously why impractical campaign pronouncements were so seductive for so long.",
        "HILLARY CLINTON made one of the most consequential announcements of her campaign on Monday \u2014 and hardly anyone is talking about it. The Democratic presidential nominee released a strategy \u2014 and, unlike much of what she has proposed this election season, it has a real chance of becoming law. Congress has over the past several years put serious effort into reforming the federal government\u2019s efforts, producing \u2014 but not yet passing \u2014 a slew of bills with bipartisan backing.",

        "Donald Trump\u2019s outreach to African Americans is as phony as anything he has said or done in this campaign (including the promise to make Mexico pay for the border wall). Until a couple of weeks ago, he showed little interest in African American voters, declining to give any speeches to predominantly black audiences. He comically refers to these Americans as \u201cthe blacks\u201d (as in \u201cThe blacks love me! \u201d) and insists their lives are a \u201cdisaster. \u201d He imagines they all live in poverty and have \u201cno jobs.",
        "No, we shouldn\u2019t have blurred the \u201cTrump 2016\u2033 of a man who rescued an infant from a car in a New Jersey parking lot. That\u2019s what cable channel HLN is saying today. \u201cWe blurred the logo and shouldn\u2019t have; it was done in error,\u201d reads a statement from the network.

        "MIDWAY ATOLL \u2014 On Thursday, President Obama touched down here, a sliver of land in the North Pacific so removed from other human development that it feels like the edge of the universe. For more than two years, he had been hoping to visit a place like this, even though his counselor John D. Podesta told him America\u2019s most pristine marine reserves are \u201cthe middle of nowhere.",
        "A few years ago, researchers from Indiana University discovered a disturbing pattern at the 2013 Swimming World Championships in Barcelona. According to the data, athletes assigned to the outer lanes of the pool were consistently swimming faster in one direction than the other. A mysterious force seemed to be interfering with the competition. But before the researchers could investigate in person, the pool \u2014 a temporary facility constructed just for that event \u2014 was torn down. The same strange problem cropped up at the Rio Olympics, and nobody can explain why.",

        "Donald Trump paid the IRS a $2, 500 penalty this year, an official at Trump\u2019s company said, after it was revealed that Trump\u2019s charitable foundation had violated tax laws by giving a political contribution to a campaign group connected to Florida\u2019s attorney general. The improper donation, a $25, 000 gift from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, was made in 2013.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with his Hispanic advisory council a couple of weeks ago left its members so excited that some even told reporters that Trump was about to significantly soften his approach to illegal immigration and maybe even embrace a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Those advisers got a reality check Wednesday night, when Trump gave arguably his toughest speech on illegal immigration yet \u2014 promising a crackdown and saying that every undocumented immigrant is subject to deportation.",
