        "As SpaceX prepared to test fire the powerful engines of its Falcon 9 rocket, an explosion rocked its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Thursday morning, blowing up the rocket, making it the second the company has lost in a fireball in just over a year. There were no humans on board, and no one was hurt. But the massive explosion could be felt for miles and a plume of dark, thick smoke hung over the coastline as emergency officials scrambled to assess the damage.",
        "Old family photographs on Marisa Vesco\u2019s bed. (Gaia ) My grandmother\u2019s life and mine overlapped for 27 years. I always called her \u201cNonna. \u201d Our age difference and profoundly contrasting values and way of thinking did not prevent us from developing a strong bond and a relationship punctuated by mischievous games and moments of tenderness and humor. We were amused by our differences. \u201cYou know, I was still young when you were born,\u201d she told me a few weeks before she died. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like we grew up together.",
        "Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her staffers employed an informal and sometimes haphazard system for exchanging and storing sensitive information and were at times either unaware or unconcerned with State Department policy, documents from an FBI investigation into her private email server system show. The documents reveal a myriad of new details about the email and show that investigators found multiple attempts by hackers to access Clinton\u2019s system \u2014 a series of personal devices and servers that the Democratic presidential candidate told investigators she used as a matter of convenience while she was secretary of state.",
        "On Friday afternoon, the FBI released its report on the investigation into the private email server Hillary Clinton used while serving as secretary of state. (The FBI also released an document detailing its interview with Clinton in early July.) I went through the report, highlighting things I either found interesting or didn\u2019t know. My notes \u2014 in the chronological order I made them while going through the report \u2014 are below.",
        "RALEIGH, N. C. \u2014 The emails to the North Carolina election board seemed routine at the time. \u201cIs there any way to get a breakdown of the 2008 voter turnout, by race (white and black) and type of vote (early and Election Day)?\u201d a staffer for the state\u2019s legislature asked in January 2012. \u201cIs there no category for \u2018Hispanic\u2019 voter?\u201d a GOP lawmaker asked in March 2013 after requesting a range of data, including how many voters cast ballots outside their precinct.",
        "At basketball games at his Oregon high school, Justin Ki Hong, an adoptee from South Korea, remembers putting his hand over his heart and singing the national anthem, proud to be a citizen of the United States. It wasn\u2019t until he applied for a job years later that Ki Hong learned he had never been a citizen at all. The employer asked for proof of citizenship, and Ki Hong\u2019s Social Security number and driver\u2019s license, which had worked when applying for college financial aid, were suddenly insufficient.",
        "Pope Francis will canonize Mother Teresa on Sunday, declaring the sainthood of a figure renowned for her ministry to the poor and dying. Yet as the pope celebrates her sanctity, he will also be furthering a boom in the business of minting saints during his papacy. Theologians and papal watchers say Francis is proclaiming new saints at a rate not seen since the heady days of John Paul II, the church\u2019s canonization champion.",
        "It looks more and more as if Donald Trump\u2019s reality show isn\u2019t going to be renewed for another season. I\u2019m not talking about \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d the NBC show Trump turned into a classic of the reality genre; that show is now in the strong hands of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The show that\u2019s in trouble is the horrifying yet irresistible one we\u2019ve all been watching since June 2015. Trump\u2019s campaign is the apotheosis of reality television\u2019s hostile takeover of the U. S.",
        "Call to mind Ed Brooke, the D. C. late U. S. senator from Massachusetts. Think of abolitionist, orator and author Frederick Douglass, and civil rights leader James Farmer. The three were separated by occupation, and in Douglass\u2019s case, generations. But they had two things in common: Each was an African American, and each was a Republican. Now consider the Rev. Mark Burns, the black Republican televangelist from South Carolina who pops up from time to time on cable news as a leading Donald Trump surrogate. Some context. Brooke was the nation\u2019s first popularly elected black senator.",
        "Norman J. Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the author, with Thomas E. Mann, of \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism. \u201d I met Tom Korologos in 1970. I was doing interviews for my dissertation on congressional staffs; he was the top staffer for Wallace Bennett, a veteran Republican senator from Utah. Tom not only granted me an interview but also gave me a ton of time and valuable insights. He knew and loved the Senate, knew and loved politics.",
        "Lie down with dogs, get up with fleas, the old saying goes. If so, Donald Trump should be awfully itchy. Trump has just augmented his cast of mostly campaign operatives with a new deputy campaign manager, conservative activist David Bossie. \u201cA friend of mine for many years,\u201d Trump told my Post colleague Robert Costa. \u201cSolid. Smart. Loves politics, knows how to win. \u201d That\u2019s one way to put it. Win at any cost would be another, and that\u2019s being polite.",
        "William R. Sweeney Jr. is president and chief executive of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. Chad Vickery is director of IFES\u2019s Center for Applied Research and Learning, and Katherine Ellena is the organization\u2019s senior legal specialist. Is the U. S. presidential election vulnerable to manipulation by a losing candidate? Could the integrity of our electoral process be successfully challenged? Unfortunately, the answer to these questions is yes. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) has supported the integrity of political and electoral processes in more than 145 countries for nearly 30 years.",
        "IN THE face of the most calamitous refugee crisis since World War II, the United States has finally begun granting refuge to displaced Syrians on a pace that, while still unequal to the problem\u2019s scale and the United States\u2019 capacity, at least starts to acknowledge that a crisis exists. In an announcement Monday, the White House said the administration had met its goal of granting asylum to 10, 000 Syrians in the current fiscal year, which ends in a month. Officials said they expect to continue accepting asylum applications in coming weeks and months.",
        "APALACHICOLA, Fla. \u2014 Hermine stormed onto Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast as a Category 1 hurricane early Friday, as the strongest storm to hit the state in more than a decade brought pounding rain, powerful winds and storm surges that forced some evacuations as the system began its crawl up the Atlantic coast. Hermine was downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before 5 a. m. but still packed sustained winds of near 70 mph moving into southern Georgia, the U. S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm then weakened as it drifted inland.",
        "Islam Karimov, the Communist Party apparatchik who transformed Uzbekistan into a brutal personal fiefdom while reaping political and economic benefits from the U. S. war in Afghanistan, has died in Tashkent. He was 78. The president\u2019s death was announced Sept. 2 by state television after days of official silence about his health. His daughter, Lola wrote on verified social media accounts that he had suffered a \u201ccerebral hemorrhage\u201d on Aug. 27. His death brings a threat of instability but offers slight chance of change in Uzbekistan, a landlocked, mostly Muslim country in Central Asia that Mr.",
        "ITHACA, N. Y. \u2014 When he was 2, Jeremy Shuler was reading books in English and Korean. At 6, he was studying calculus. Now, at an age when most kids are attending middle school, the exuberant is a freshman at Cornell University, the youngest the Ivy League school has on record. \u201cIt\u2019s risky to extrapolate, but if you look at his trajectory and he stays on course, one day he\u2019ll solve some problem we haven\u2019t even conceived of,\u201d said Cornell Engineering Dean Lance Collins. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty exciting.",
        "The epic battles between the Clintons and their tormentors on the right have shaped American politics for nearly a quarter century. But there was a moment early on when the toxic course of that history might have been changed, had it not been for Hillary Clinton\u2019s impulses toward secrecy. It came one weekend near the end of Bill Clinton\u2019s first year as president, and pitted the first lady against her husband\u2019s advisers.",
        "Literally one day after winning his primary, Sen. John McCain ( .) gave up on Donald Trump. In fact, McCain now sounds a bit like he\u2019s betting on Trump losing \u2014 or, at least, looking like a loser for the rest of the campaign season \u2014 to help him win a sixth term in the Senate. In a gauzy, YouTube video released Wednesday, McCain looks directly at the camera and says: \u201dMy opponent, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, is a good person.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s immigration position is, at its heart, fairly simple. People in the country illegally will be subject to deportation if he is elected president, as he said in his speech this week in Arizona. Even those who hadn\u2019t crossed the border illegally but who had been admitted on a visa and then didn\u2019t leave are \u201da big problem\u201d in Trump\u2019s estimation. \u201dImmigration law doesn\u2019t exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out,\u201d he said.",
        "Less than three months after the Supreme Court vacated the convictions of former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell, the U. S. attorney\u2019s office that prosecuted the Republican has recommended to Justice Department that they endeavor to try him again, according to people familiar with the case. The recommendation from the U. S. attorney\u2019s office in the Eastern District of Virginia does not guarantee that McDonnell will once again have to battle corruption charges in court. The decision ultimately rests with senior officials at the Justice Department, including the deputy attorney general and possibly the attorney general.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday that it is banning the use of several common ingredients in antibacterial soaps and washes. It also said such products were no more effective than conventional soap and water in preventing illnesses and may pose health risks. The rule applies to 19 active ingredients including the most common, triclosan and triclocarban in liquid soaps, bar soaps and other items. Manufacturers will have one year to remove the ingredients from their products or to take them off the market, the agency said.",
        "They started up the peak in northern Pakistan on Aug. 21. The two were to reach the summit and descend in five days. But two weeks later, the mountain climbers from Utah have yet to return. The Alpine Club of Pakistan announced Thursday that Kyle Dempster and Scott Adamson, who arrived in Pakistan on July 24 for a expedition, were missing in the region, the Associated Press reported. Spokesman Karrar Haidri said the club got in touch with local authorities and the climbers\u2019 families after they did not return on the expected date, the Associated Press reported.",
        "Brock Turner, who was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman outside a Stanford University fraternity house, was released from a Northern California jail Friday morning after serving half of his widely criticized sentence. Turner was released shortly after 6 a. m. local time and left the jail without saying a word, according to reporters in San Jose. #BrockTurner walks out of jail without saying a word to the media.

        "When I assigned an biography of Andrew Carnegie for a new undergraduate course on wealth and poverty at George Mason University a few years ago, I wasn\u2019t sure the students would actually read it. Not only did most of them make it to the end, however, but many thanked me for giving them the chance to read a popular work of history. Curious, I inquired how many were history majors. Of the 24 honors students in the seminar, there were none. English? Philosophy? Fine arts? Only one. How was this possible? I asked.",
        "Seven years ago, Sian Davey was a psychotherapist living in London when the sculptor Louise Bourgeois revealed a path for her. As Davey walked through the Bourgeois retrospective at the Tate Modern, upset by a recent miscarriage, she realized she had to create something in order to let go of her grief. Davey chose a Mamiya 7 film camera as her tool and color film as her medium. \u201cPhotography helped me frame what I felt,\u201d says Davey who later became pregnant with her fourth child. This time it was almost certain the baby would be born with Downs Syndrome.",
        "DETROIT \u2014 Donald Trump made a brief visit Saturday morning to a black church in the heart of this city, the latest step in his faltering and often awkward effort to soften the edges of a candidacy hardened by racially tinged appeals that have resonated primarily with white Republicans. In what the pastor said was Trump\u2019s first visit to an African American church, the GOP presidential nominee swayed to gospel music, held a baby, accepted a prayer shawl and told the congregation he was there to listen to their concerns.",
        "Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the Republican nominee, said Saturday that he would release his tax returns \u201cin the next week,\u201d but he was less clear about the timeline for his running mate, Donald Trump. \u201cDonald Trump and I are both going to release our tax returns. I\u2019ll release mine in the next week,\u201d Pence said in an interview taped for NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press. \u201d But Pence maintained, as Trump has for months, that a federal audit is responsible for delaying the release of the businessman\u2019s documents.",
        "For those who wish this long and often dismal presidential campaign were over, help is already here. To the rescue have come the forecasters \u2014 political scientists with prediction models that have already called the election, in some cases many months ago. Their work will soon be published collectively in the upcoming issue of the journal PS: Political Science and Politics. On Friday, a handful of the forecasters appeared in Philadelphia at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association to offer their thoughts.",
        "HANGZHOU, China \u2014 The problems began as soon as President Obama landed in China. There were no stairs waiting for him to emerge from his usual door at the front of Air Force One. On the tarmac, as Obama\u2019s staffers scrambled to get stairs in place for him to disembark, White House press photographers traveling with him tried to get in their usual position to mark his arrival in a foreign country, only to find a member of the Chinese welcoming delegation screaming at them. He told the White House press corps that they needed to leave.",
        "This story has been updated. President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping formally joined the Paris climate accord on Saturday, handing over signed documents to United Nations Secretary General Ban in Hangzhou, China and giving a major push toward bringing the plan into force before the end of the year. Though the international climate deal was sealed in Paris last December, it still needs to be signed and delivered by at least 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions to achieve a legal status called \u201centry into force."
