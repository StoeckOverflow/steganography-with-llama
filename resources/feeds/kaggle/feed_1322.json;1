        "Hillary Clinton and her campaign have been going out of their way to make a surprising argument about Donald Trump: He\u2019s not really a Republican. At the Democratic convention, several speakers said Trump represented a complete break from the conservative traditions of the GOP. Last month, Clinton delivered a similar message in a speech linking Trump to the political movement known as the \u201c . \u201d \u201cThis is not conservatism as we have known it,\u201d she asserted.",
        "A federal state of emergency was declared in Louisiana two weeks ago after severe flooding crippled the southern part of the state. The Baton Rouge area received over 6 trillion gallons of rainwater in only two days, causing more than 10 rivers to overflow and inflicting damage on more than 100, 000 homes. Now, homeowners and volunteers like me are dealing with the wreckage. Step 1: Remove all furniture Floods make no distinction between socioeconomic classes, so the Goodwill sofa and the Pottery Barn sectional will be equally ruined and unceremoniously dumped on the front lawn.",
        "In the aftermath of Anthony Weiner s latest sext scandal, he found a surprising ally:\u00c2 Dan Savage. In a Monday interview, the sex columnist said that Weiner should be seen as the victim of revenge porn, ? a\u00c2 malicious act in which sexual photographs are shared without the consent of the subject, usually to humiliate or harm. Revenge porn (more accurately called involuntary or nonconsensual pornography) is now illegal in several states and, thanks to a bill that is currently in front of Congress, may soon be a federal crime.",
        "Moshe Marvit is a labor and employment lawyer and a fellow at the Century Foundation. He is the of \u201cWhy Labor Organizing Should Be a Civil Right. \u201d The first Labor Day celebration took place 134 years ago in New York City, at a time when organizing a union was not yet a protected right. In that era, labor unions were often viewed as criminal conspiracies, and a few years later, with the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act, they were treated as trusts.",
        "* Tropical storm warning for North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey beaches | Storm surge warning for Hampton Roads north through New Jersey * 3 p. m. update: Hermine is slamming the coastline with huge waves and strong wind. In Ocean City, Md. wind gusts have reached 40 mph. In its 2 p. m. update, the National Hurricane Center said that the center of the storm was about 90 miles east of the Outer Banks, but its impacts stretch up and down the Eastern Seaboard.",
        "NAIROBI \u2014 The last time the lions charged through Simon Saigilu\u2019s village, he was ready. He jumped out of bed with a flashlight and a spear, emitting a scream that was the closest thing anyone here had to an alarm. He\u2019d had time to practice. Every month or two, the lions appeared, after sneaking through the fence that runs between the village and Nairobi National Park, at the edge of this city of 3 million. The barrier was supposed to be electrified, but it wasn\u2019t.",
        "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 A earthquake in the edge of Oklahoma\u2019s key areas rattled the Midwest from Nebraska to North Texas on Saturday, and likely will bring fresh attention to the practice of disposing oil and gas field wastewater deep underground. The United States Geological Survey said a 5. 6 magnitude earthquake happened at 7:02 a. m. Saturday in Oklahoma, on the fringe of an area where regulators had stepped in to limit wastewater disposal. That temblor matches a November 2011 quake in the same region. An increase in magnitude 3.",
        "By the time Michelle Burton and a dozen other Birmingham, Ala. police officers arrived at an apartment Tuesday night, it was too late to save a man, who died of an apparent drug overdose. On the couch lay a woman, slack and unresponsive, but with a faint pulse. Paramedics on the scene administered a dose of Narcan, a opioid antidote, before rushing her to the hospital. Then there was the matter of the couple\u2019s shaken children: a girl, a boy, a boy and a girl clad in a tiny purple gingham dress.",
        "Mark Burns\u2019s very bad week just got much worse. Days after the top Trump backer and Republican convention speaker was forced to apologize for tweeting a cartoon of Hillary Clinton in blackface, CNN did some digging into his apparently inflated bio claims. The televangelist on Friday night admitted to overstating some of his claims on his Facebook page. Then, on Saturday morning, CNN aired this brutal interview with Burns, in which he struggles to explain his readily apparent r\u00e9sum\u00e9 inflation. It gets tough to watch at certain points. Here\u2019s a recap: 1.",
        "Police in Santa Clara, Calif. have threatened to stop securing Levi\u2019s Stadium during games as long as quarterback Colin Kaepernick continues to protest during the national anthem, NBC Bay Area reports. \u201cI\u2019m already hearing it this week that next week on \u2018Monday Night Football,\u2019 some officers are not going to work,\u201d Frank Saunders, president of the Santa Clara Police Officers Association, said via NBC. If the police officers, who make up of the force that secures the stadium choose not to work, the team will be pressed to quickly hire more security personnel.",
        "As Labor Day approaches, and a single day of rest from all the hours we Americans spend on the job is upon us, people can\u2019t seem to stop talking about the crazy hours they work. One of the articles on the Wall Street Journal\u2019s web site last week was a piece about how 4 a. m. a time so ungodly there\u2019s even a TED Talk about how surreal it is has become the most productive hour for .",
        "The idea started on an empty alley lot in Northeast Washington\u2019s Stronghold neighborhood. Brian Levy wanted to show those around him the benefits of minimal and environmentally friendly living. So in 2012, he enlisted an architecture firm and builder to construct a house on wheels \u2014 a particularly chic structure with kitchen countertops and maple floors. It garnered media attention \u2014 a couple of spreads in glossy design magazines \u2014 and some quibbles from neighbors who had grown accustomed to parking on the empty lot.",
        "On a road trip from Kentucky to California, highway mile markers ticked off the stretches of silence between me and my high school sweetheart. We were eight months away from heartbreak, and we had no idea. I have limited recollection of our roadside arguments; instead my mind returns often to the happy scenes. Playing in the St. Louis City Museum ball pit. Camping next to a field of hardened lava in Carrizozo, N. M. Walking in the neon glow of the Las Vegas Strip.",
        "You may remember the phenomenon that was \u2014 is \u2014 the Patti LaBelle sweet potato pie. [How Patti LaBelle\u2019s sweet potato Patti Pies became the stuff of Internet legend] The dessert available at Walmart under the Patti\u2019s Good Life line received more than a little boost last year when James Wright Chanel posted a video review (seen more than 5 million times on YouTube) in which he punctuated his commentary and bites with musical interludes of LaBelle lyrics.",
        "The roar of a basketball arena blares from the den as my son and a friend crouch over my iPad. They\u2019ve cajoled me into a of screen time playing NBA 2K, a popular video game. Soon, a frustrated rumble erupts from the sofa. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn!\u201d A simple enough scenario. And yet I am paralyzed by conflicting thoughts: Do I intervene or let them sort it out? My instincts say \u201cGrab that iPad away faster than you can say \u2018Stephen Curry\u2019 and give it to the guest. \u201d But is that the best call?",
        "GREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014 Sen. Ron Johnson runs down a litany of the United States\u2019 ills: a rising debt and deficit, unsecured borders, threats from the Islamic State. And he knows just what to blame: an overreaching federal government stepping on the throats of American entrepreneurs. \u201cSometimes I refer to myself as Mr. Sunshine,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican tells the employees of a small firm here. \u201cAnd I do it somewhat facetiously because, let\u2019s face it, I am laying out realities that are not the brightest every now and again.",
        "DALTON, Ga. \u2014 When Mike Pence campaigned in Georgia last week, the Republican nominee carved out time for a private meeting with commentator Erick Erickson, a member of the GOP\u2019s Never Trump faction. When Pence passed through Arizona last month, he paid a personal visit to another loud Donald Trump resister, Sen. Jeff Flake, who had scolded Trump for his incendiary statements during a meeting between the presidential nominee and Republican senators.",
        "HANGZHOU, China \u2014 Efforts by the United States and Russia to forge a deal for a in Syria and to coordinate their counterterrorism operations there faltered again Sunday, even as a major new offensive in the besieged city of Aleppo appeared to undermine key components of the proposed agreement. After an anticipated news conference did not take place, Secretary of State John F.",
        "DALLAS \u2014 Sgt. Ivan Gunter climbed the stairs, sweating beneath a tactical vest, his finger resting beside the trigger of his 9mm handgun. He could hear the suspect\u2019s muffled voice above, between thunderous cracks of gunfire. Gunter, 49, led a specially trained team of nine Dallas police officers called the Foxtrots. In the July twilight, beneath the city\u2019s skyscrapers, a gunman had taken aim at his officers as they stood along Main Street policing a protest rally. One fell, then a second, and a third.",
        "KOLKATA, India \u2014 With solemn prayer mixed with joyful songs, Christians in this Indian city celebrated the sainthood of Mother Teresa on Sunday, honoring the nun who worked tirelessly for the poor here and indelibly shaped the city\u2019s image in the eyes of the world. A crowd of about 300 gathered outside the narrow lane leading to the modest Mother House of the order that Mother Teresa founded. They listened to a short service and watched the proceedings from Rome on a large television screen.",
        "Josh Rogin is a columnist for the Global Opinions section of The Post. With only two months left until the presidential election, the most senior national security figures in the Republican Party are largely staying on the sidelines, even though almost all are said to privately oppose Donald Trump becoming commander in chief. Many of their more junior colleagues are calling on them to get off the bench.",
        "Barack Obama took office in 2009 with two big personal priorities in foreign policy: the limitation of nuclear weapons and the cause of Palestinian statehood. This summer the president has been weighing a flurry of possible actions to cement his legacy on nukes, including a U. N. resolution that would ban testing. That raises an obvious question: Will Obama also launch an Mideast gambit? The possibility has been debated in and outside the White House ever since Secretary of State John F. Kerry\u2019s quixotic effort to broker an deal collapsed in 2014.",
        "You would have thought that Labor Day 2016 would bring us a serious conversation about lifting the incomes of American workers and expanding their opportunities for advancement. After all, we have spent the year talking incessantly about alienated voters and a new populism rooted in the disaffection of those hammered by economic change. But this is not the discussion we are having. Instead, we are enduring an between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Their strategies are entirely rational.",
        "Forget the \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2014 at least for now. On Labor Day 2016, we are in the midst of a historic transformation of the U. S. job market. Popular attention focuses on Uber and similar networks that unite buyers and sellers. TaskRabbit, for example, creates a platform for people who need something done (grocery shopping, plumbing) and for those willing, for a price, to do it. The free market at its best, say advocates. Not so, say critics. This creates rampant income and job insecurity. Either way, the gig economy is overrated. It\u2019s not the main engine of change.",
        "AS THE presidential campaign enters its final stretch, this seems like a good time to ask: Will American voters allow themselves to be insulted, taken for granted and made fools of? Donald Trump seems to be betting that the answer is yes. How else to judge his assumption that he can be elected without sharing basic information? He has released no meaningful health records. He has put forward virtually no serious policy proposals. Unlike every other nominee of the modern era, he refuses to release his tax forms.",
        "ONE POPULAR view of this unedifying election cycle is that it\u2019s an instance of working people \u2014 oppressed, underemployed, underpaid \u2014 rising up against the Establishment, whatever that might be. Polling shows that supporters of the insurgent leader in this drama, Donald Trump, are not in fact an impoverished peasantry in revolt \u2014 their household income is above the national average. Still, those who labor for a living do have reason to worry about the future.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Turkish troops and Syrian rebels on Sunday pushed the Islamic State out of the remaining stretch of territory the group had controlled along the border, severing the militants\u2019 last access to the outside world. Since 2013, when the group announced its formation, it has had territory bordering a NATO state \u2014 Turkey \u2014 but the sweep by Turkish forces and rebels fighting under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army has brought that to an end.",
        "5:30 p. m. update At 5 p. m. Hermine was positioned about 335 miles east of Ocean City and contained maximum sustained winds of 70 mph. It was drifting at 5 mph, farther away from land. Given its distance away from the coast and current movement, tropical storm warnings have been dropped south of Fenwick Island, Del. They remain in effect from Bethany Beach, Del. to Nantucket, Block Island, and Martha\u2019s Vineyard in southern New England, where they were recently extended. Business owners clean up the boardwalk after Tropical Storm Hermine passed through Ocean City, Md.",
        "For normal people, the cycle starts now. (By normal, I mean, well, not me.) Labor Day is the traditional start of the final two or so months of the presidential campaign \u2014 a time when even the casual political watcher starts to pay some attention to the race that I (and my fellow political junkies) have spent more than two years of our collective lives thinking and writing about.",
        "Barack Obama swept into the White House in 2008 thanks to strong support from what was, at the time, the most diverse electorate in history. Nearly a quarter of voters that year were 23. 7 percent of them according to data from the Census Bureau. As it turns out, that\u2019s the same percentage of the electorate that was nonwhite in 2014. In 1980, exit polling shows that 88 percent of voters in the presidential election were white."
