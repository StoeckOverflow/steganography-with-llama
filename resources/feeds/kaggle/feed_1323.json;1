        "Several of Donald Trump\u2019s top campaign advisers and allies on Sunday struggled to explain the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s stance on mass deportation \u2014 insisting that he will prioritize undocumented criminals for deportation, but falling short on other details and playing down the scale of his deportation priorities by millions of people.",
        "After achieving success in Rio, U. S. gold medal winners have been taking victory tours of sorts back home, and members of the \u201cFinal Five\u201d are no exception. Saturday saw Laurie Hernandez and Madison Kocian throw out first pitches for their favorite baseball teams, the Mets and Rangers, respectively, just hours apart. Of course, when you\u2019re a member of the U. S. women\u2019s gymnastics team, you don\u2019t just toe the rubber and toss the ball. Both Hernandez and Kocian showed off their acrobatic skills in delivering first pitches few would even dream of attempting.",
        "In February 2014, the White House released a photograph of President Obama standing alone in the Oval Office, contemplating two paintings by Edward Hopper recently borrowed from the Whitney Museum of American Art. Obama\u2019s back was turned to the viewer, and the pose recalled a trope of presidential iconography: the lonely leader, taking a pensive moment to contemplate the eternal verities, indulging in a brief caesura in the whirl of politics, power and strife that defines the job. Perhaps the most famous example is a similar 1961 image, by photographer George Tames, showing President John F.",
        "When NPR announced last month that it would no longer feature comments from readers on its website, general rejoicing followed. \u201cGood riddance \u2014 and everybody else should do the same\u201d was the tone of the response I saw on Twitter. USA Today columnist Rem Rieder, noting that other news organizations are moving away from comments as well, wrote, \u201cTheir disappearance is welcome. \u201d And even NPR\u2019s ombudswoman, Elizabeth Jensen, wrote that the move made sense to her, since such a small slice of the audience was participating.

        "When Comedy Central canceled Larry Wilmore\u2019s \u201cThe Nightly Show\u201d this summer, the network president gave a brutal explanation: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t resonated,\u201d he said \u2014 rather candidly pointing out the currency that rules our marketplace. The current season in media has felt like a parade of noise machines built for maximum resonance, from the political conventions to the Olympics to \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d to the Kanye Swift feud. Such events generated an endless churn of controversies and memes, to the point where we weren\u2019t sure whether they were legitimate news stories or that only deserve our ironic ridicule.",
        "How can anyone take standardized test scores seriously when stuff like this happens? It\u2019s bad enough that students are required to take standardized tests that are often poorly designed and administered, don\u2019t assess what kids have learned, and have \u201ccut scores\u201d deliberately set high so few students can get top scores. What\u2019s more, some of these \u201caccountability\u201d tests have no consequences for the kids but high stakes for their teachers and schools.",

The Barbie dream car, friends call it. \u201cThat is news to no one,\u201d I said. Theo knows I\u2019ve never wanted kids. My biological clock has simply never ticked. It\u2019s not a political statement, a reaction, or result of any relationship. It is a fact. One that\u2019s hard for many to believe. \u201cYou know what you are?\u201d she asked, and I braced myself.",

        "A coalition of civil rights groups, Democratic lawyers and the Obama administration has scored significant victories in overturning strict voting laws, highlighting how the death of Justice Antonin Scalia has removed the Supreme Court as a crucial conservative backstop for such measures. With the presidential election approaching, the challengers have rung up wins against their two top targets.

        "Donald Trump said Monday that he would have left the summit in China over a logistical flap that left President Obama disembarking Air Force One onto a plain metal staircase. The president\u2019s subdued arrival on Saturday afternoon, from a secondary exit on the presidential plane, stood in contrast to other world leaders who departed their planes onto stairs \u2014 and some, including Trump, perceived it as a snub by Chinese officials.

        "Barack Obama took office in 2009 with two big personal priorities in foreign policy: the limitation of nuclear weapons and the cause of Palestinian statehood. This summer the president has been weighing a flurry of possible actions to cement his legacy on nukes, including a U. N. resolution that would ban testing. That raises an obvious question: Will Obama also launch an Mideast gambit? The possibility has been debated in and outside the White House ever since Secretary of State John F.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s harsh speech in Arizona last week on immigration convinced many in the camp that he was committed to deporting all of those here illegally. No softening!
