        "Donald Trump was the mainstream face of a fringe movement five years ago that questioned Barack Obama\u2019s place of birth and qualifications for office, eventually prompting the president to release a certificate proving his birth in Hawaii. Trump has never apologized, recanted his charges or even admitted error. Instead, he tries not to discuss it. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about it because if I talk about that, your whole thing will be about that,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard his plane on Labor Day. \u201cSo I don\u2019t talk about it.",
        "The sheriff\u2019s deputy paces slowly at the foot of the school auditorium stage, a gold badge pinned to the pocket of his polo shirt, a gun holstered at his hip. His expression is somber. He would look right at home leading a DARE or program, warning teenagers against ruining their lives with drug use or street crime.",
        "It took years for Roger Ailes to build Fox News Channel into the dominant player in cable news. It\u2019s taken just two months for its future to become uncertain. The network took twin blows on Tuesday, culminating a summer of turbulence. Fox\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, agreed to pay $20 million to former Fox host Gretchen Carlson to settle her claims against Ailes, the network founder and former GOP strategist who was ousted in July amid widespread allegations of unsavory behavior.",
        "Donald Trump just renewed his vow of opacity. Asked by ABC News\u2019s David Muir on Monday afternoon whether he\u2019d be releasing his returns, as every other presidential nominee has done for 40 years, Trump brushed off the inquiry. \u201cI think people don\u2019t care,\u201d the GOP nominee declared. No? A Quinnipiac University poll two weeks ago found that 74 percent of likely voters, including 62 percent of Republicans, think Trump should release his tax returns. And for those Americans who don\u2019t care, there\u2019s more evidence every day that they should.",
        "The writer is an entrepreneur and investor. Our government used to get things done. The Manhattan Project coordinated the work of more than 130, 000 people in over a dozen states. It was difficult, unprecedented \u2014 and successful. Less than four years after President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave the the United States detonated the world\u2019s first atomic bomb. Today our government finds it hard just to make a website.",
        "\u201cI think it\u2019s a misunderstanding. \u201d The Washington Post spoke to football fans at a preseason tailgate about the role of politics in football and this is what they said. (Dalton Washington Post) So answered San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick when asked what he thought about being booed for refusing to stand during the national anthem at last week\u2019s preseason game against the San Diego Chargers. He was right. It was a misunderstanding.",
        "A MONTH ago, Donald Trump and officials in his campaign assured voters they would organize a news conference to clear up questions about the legal means by which his wife, Melania, entered the country in the and obtained a green card several years before they were married in 2005. Those questions persist, the Trump campaign has refused to answer them, and no such news conference has occurred. Ms. Trump insists she violated no immigration laws; that may prove to be the case.",
        "Despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent slip in the polls, she has a big political opportunity, even though some of her advisers might regard it as a curse: She can run as the candidate who represents the \u201cmainstream\u201d leadership of both parties and knows how to fix our broken political system. In a year when has been a dominant theme in both parties, donning this establishment mantle might appear to be a mistake for Clinton. But let\u2019s be honest: Her strength is that she\u2019s the voice of experienced, centrist leadership.",
        "The animal kingdom will have lost one of its staunchest defenders when the Oval Office is abandoned by Barack Obama, who through a series of critical administrative rulemakings has done more to protect animals than any other president in recent memory. This will be especially devastating if Donald Trump replaces him \u2014 not only because of his sons\u2019 lust for hunting exotic game but also because his recently announced agriculture advisory committee includes several active opponents of animal protection policies. By now, many will have seen the photographs circulating on social media of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.",
        "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is sorry he insulted President Obama \u2014 sort of. He now \u201dregrets\u201d that calling Obama \u201dson of a whore\u201d caused so much controversy. On Monday, Duterte lashed out at the United States for raising questions about a \u201ddrug war\u201d that has killed 2, 400 Filipinos. The United States responded by canceling a meeting. Today, Duterte tried to walk the comment back. \u201dNot personal,\u201d he said. The incident, unsurprisingly, is making headlines.",
        "NORRISTOWN, Pa. \u2014 In a significant development, prosecutors in the sexual assault trial of comedian Bill Cosby divulged for the first time Tuesday that they will ask a Pennsylvania judge to allow testimony from 13 women who have accused Cosby of sexual abuse. The women, whose names have not been disclosed, would be called to the witness stand in an effort to establish a pattern of past conduct by Cosby, who faces felony charges for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former Temple University women\u2019s basketball team official, in 2004.",
        "Moments after Danny Heinrich abducted Jacob Wetterling on a rural road in Minnesota, the man handcuffed the boy and forced him into a car. Jacob looked at Heinrich and asked, \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Soon, Jacob was dead. Giving graphic details in a Minnesota courtroom, Heinrich laid to rest a mystery: What happened to Jacob in 1989 after he was abducted by a masked man holding a gun? Danny Heinrich (Sherburne County Sheriff\u2019s Office via AP) Heinrich admitted in court Tuesday that he abducted, sexually assaulted and killed the boy.",
        "On a weekend afternoon in a city scarred by escalating violence, Kris Pinder watched his children play at a park festival in Roseland, a neighborhood on Chicago\u2019s South Side. The harmonies of a gospel choir bubbled up through loudspeakers while clippers buzzed across the scalps of little boys in barber chairs. Basketballs flew across a nearby court, and tennis balls bounced over nets on another. By the end of Labor Day weekend, the city had reportedly exceeded its homicide total for all of 2015 after a surge in gunfire over the holiday.",
        "House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz on Tuesday requested yet another Justice Department investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton \u2014 this one focused on emails that a tech company staffer deleted in spite of a congressional committee\u2019s request that they be preserved. In the letter \u2014 addressed to the U. S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Channing D. Phillips, and copied to Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and FBI Director James B.",
        "Brock Turner, a former Stanford University student who was convicted in March of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman outside a Stanford fraternity house, registered as a sex offender in Ohio on Tuesday morning, four days after his release from a Northern California jail. Turner\u2019s parents were by his side as he filled out the paperwork at the Greene County Sheriff\u2019s Office, a process that took about 20 minutes, NBC News reported. While there, Turner\u2019s mother tried to shield her son\u2019s face with a white sweater, and Turner did not speak to reporters, according to NBC.",
        "ITT Educational Services, one of the largest operators of technical schools, ended operations at all of its ITT Technical Institutes on Tuesday, citing government action to curtail the company\u2019s access to millions of dollars in federal loans and grants, a critical source of revenue. The move to shut down the chain of career schools after 50 years arrives two weeks after the Education Department said ITT would no longer be allowed to enroll new students who rely on federal loans and grants, award raises, pay bonuses or make severance payments to its executives without government approval.",
        "Georgetown University, having sold enslaved black people in the 19th century, has come up with another perverse transaction: offering descendants of those enslaved people an apology and preferential admissions as part of an atonement package. \u201cWe provide care and respect for the members of the Georgetown community: faculty, staff, alumni, those with an enduring relationship with Georgetown,\u201d University President John DeGioia said last week. \u201cWe will provide the same care and respect to the descendants. \u201d [Georgetown plans to apologize for its role in slavery] The same?",
        "Jessica Smock is a former teacher, teaching fellow, and curriculum coordinator with a doctorate in educational policy from Boston University. She is also the mom of a son who is about to enter kindergarten and a toddler daughter. Smock says her research and writing have always been about politics and education, gender, and college access. \u201cSo when I was told that my son was not \u201cready\u201d for kindergarten, I was baffled. Ready for what exactly?\u201d she wrote in an . \u201cReady for what\u201d is a good question.",
        "Donald Trump, in a sharp nod to the conservative foreign policy establishment, called Wednesday for a robust expansion of U. S. military capabilities and an end to budget sequestration on defense spending \u2014 which he called essential to national security in an effort to draw contrasts to President Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. \u201cAs soon as I take office, I will ask congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military. It is so depleted.",
        "Donald Trump used to have a simple theory for how politicians worked. \u201cWhen you give,\u201d he said last year, \u201cthey do whatever the hell you want them to do. \u201d Now, this year\u2019s Trump seems to think last year\u2019s Trump was wrong. The Republican nominee is facing new scrutiny over a 2013 episode where his theory of politics seemed to work perfectly \u2014 and casting it, instead, as an innocent transaction with no strings attached. Back then, Trump\u2019s charitable foundation gave a $25, 000 donation to a group backing the reelection of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s finance minister, who helped arrange U. S. presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico, has resigned, further roiling a political crisis that has been swirling here in Trump\u2019s wake. In formally announcing the resignation Wednesday, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto offered no explanation for the departure of Luis Videgaray, one of his closest aides and the architect of some of the government\u2019s signature economic reforms. But it came a week after Trump appeared with Pe\u00f1a Nieto in a meeting that was widely viewed across Mexico as an embarrassment for the country\u2019s leader.",
        "The world can be divided into two groups: those who\u2019ve never heard the name Glennon Doyle Melton, and those who know pretty much everything there is to know about her. The bulimia and the alcoholism, the anxiety, depression and drugs. They know the contents of her refrigerator, how she looks when she first wakes up, where she finds God and what she says in response to her daughter\u2019s inquiry about how babies are made. (Prayer alone doesn\u2019t cut it, she explains .) The number of people who know these things about Doyle Melton is not insignificant.",
        "Apple unveiled its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Wednesday, highlighting a lot of changes to its most important product. Eschewing a major design change, which many Apple watchers think is coming next year at the anniversary of the ubiquitous smartphone, the consumer electronics giant instead said its smartphone will offer better battery life, water resistance, and a more powerful camera. On the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple\u2019s largest model, the smartphone includes a second camera that acts as a telephoto lens. Apple\u2019s most controversial move was removing the headphone jack.",
        "The smell of fresh paint greeted lawmakers reacquainting themselves with their workplace after their break. The scaffolding was coming down, revealing a gleaming dome and, underneath it, restored friezes, oil paintings and statues. The Capitol has been returned to its former glory. If only they could do the same to Congress.",
        "The president, as he prepared to leave office, was dead broke. So broke, in fact, that he had to take out a loan to get him through the transition. Bill Clinton in 2001? No, Harry Truman in 1953 \u2014 and the resemblance ends there. Back then, although Truman had only a monthly Army pension of $112. 56, he was adamant about not employing his presidential service to cash in.",
        "Better than anyone, Donald Trump made the case for why our campaign money system is rotten. Unsurprisingly, the prime example he used was himself. \u201cI was a businessman,\u201d Trump explained at a Republican debate in August 2015. \u201cI give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me. And that\u2019s a broken system. \u201d Bravo. Sort of.",
        "TERRACE PARK, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman probably will win a second term, despite the fact that he deserves to. The swarm of young people who gathered on a Saturday morning in this Cincinnati suburb to feast on doughnuts and his gratitude are among the 5, 000 \u2030volunteer interns, including students from 35 campuses, who have made 3. 5 million voter contacts. Portman s supporters are a forgiving sort, undeterred by his many accomplishments and qualifications that could be disqualifying in this season of populist antagonism toward people who have actually governed.",
        "For years, Germany seemed immune to the forces of populist discontent raging on both sides of the Atlantic, a lone island of calm and stability. That ended on Sunday, when an election in the state of Pomerania gave the party Alternative for Germany (AfD) 20. 8 percent of the vote. It sent a nervous shudder throughout the country, shocking allies and neighbors. At home, Chancellor Angela Merkel s friends and foes alike are suddenly sniffing opportunity, one year out from national elections. Is this the twilight of her nearly reign?",
        "THE DEADLIEST month in two decades. More homicides this year than in New York and Los Angeles combined. Almost twice as many people killed as U. S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan since 2013. With each new homicide in Chicago comes a new description that tries to capture the magnitude \u2014 and horror \u2014 of the violence that has plagued America\u2019s city.",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey said in a memo to the bureau\u2019s employees that the decision not to charge Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state was \u201cnot a \u201d and, \u201cdespite all the chest beating by people no longer in government, there really wasn\u2019t a prosecutable case. \u201d The director\u2019s assessment was notable for its bluntness, though its assertions were not new. When Comey announced in July that he was not recommending charges for Clinton or her aides, he said no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case."
