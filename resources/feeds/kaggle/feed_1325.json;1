        "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Wednesday that senators refusing to vote on President Obama\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court should recognize that a president is elected for four years not three. But she also told incoming law students at Georgetown University that she did not see how a lawsuit from supporters of the nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, trying to force the Senate to act could accomplish their desired outcome. [Ginsburg regrets criticism of Trump] In response to a question, Ginsburg said the president\u2019s power to nominate Supreme Court justices is contingent on the advice and consent of the Senate.",
        "The borders of the Islamic State\u2019s \u201dcaliphate\u201d are shrinking fast. The group\u2019s strongholds in Iraq and Syria are collapsing one by one. The U. S. war has reached a point where questions are being raised about what comes next. So far, the answer seems likely to be: more war. That\u2019s partly because the U. S. strategy for defeating the Islamic State relies on a variety of regional allies and local armed groups who are often bitterly at odds. Though all of them regard the Islamic State as an enemy, most of them regard one another as enemies, too.",
        "Kristin Smart went to a college party on a May night in 1996. She was a freshman at the California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo at the time, and the night of the party, she was wearing running shorts and what the Los Angeles Times described as a \u201c . \u201d She left with other students, the newspaper reported, including Paul Flores, who was the last person to see the Smart alive and would later become a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in her disappearance. Smart went missing after that party.",
        "The Middle East\u2019s two great geopolitical adversaries entered into a war of words ahead of the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, which starts this weekend. Their rivalry, shaped by sectarian divisions, can be seen in numerous bloody proxy conflicts across the region. But it also flares up in heated rhetorical broadsides. The latest round began with comments from Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in full bluster condemned the Saudis for prohibiting Iranian pilgrims from joining the hajj after talks about security and logistics collapsed.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s prepared remarks generally serve less as railroad tracks than as aviation waypoints. They\u2019re not the unswerving path he takes as he gives a speech at a rally, they\u2019re place he wants to get to but, as long as he\u2019s close, that\u2019s good enough. In Greenville, N. C. on Tuesday night, Trump was supposed to criticize Hillary Clinton for telling the FBI that she couldn\u2019t recall details of her email server setup.",
        "Donald Trump said Wednesday he is ending his ban on several news organizations, including The Washington Post, that he had stripped of their credentials to cover his rallies and news conferences. The Post was the last and largest of about a dozen media organizations that the Republican presidential nominee banned because of what he deemed unfair coverage of his campaign. Others on the blacklist included the Huffington Post, the Daily Beast, Politico and BuzzFeed.",
        "Do you hog office conversations? Or not talk enough? Does your voice squeal? Do you sit very still at your desk all day? Or do you fidget under stress? Where do you go in the office? How much time do you spend there? To whom do you talk? An employee badge can now measure all this and more, all with the goal of giving employers better information to evaluate performance. Think of it as biometrics meets the boss.",
        "CANNON BALL, N. D. \u2014 The simmering showdown here between the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the company building the Dakota Access crude oil pipeline began as a legal battle. It has turned into a movement. Over the past few weeks, thousands of Native Americans representing tribes from all over the country have traveled to this central North Dakota reservation to camp in a nearby meadow and show solidarity with a tribe they think is once again receiving a raw deal at the hands of commercial interests and the U. S. government.",
        "As reports of police overreach and brutality in the black community become more and more commonplace in mainstream news, many black people are feeling a strange combination of frustration and relief \u2014 relief because the shootings of unarmed citizens have become part of a national discussion, but frustration because, time and time again, we hear the same dismissive and deflective responses from white America: \u201cThere must be more to the story. \u201d \u201cIf you people would just do what you\u2019re told. \u201d \u201cCops have a hard job. \u201d \u201cWhite people get shot too. \u201d \u201cHe was just another thug.",
        "After Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cRoast of Rob Lowe\u201d filmed 10 days ago, word got out almost immediately: The event really became a roast of Ann Coulter. While Lowe was clearly the target of many jokes, all of the comedians and roasters on stage (host David Spade, Nikki Glaser, Jeff Ross, Jewel, Peyton Manning, etc.) aimed especially vicious material at the conservative commentator and fellow roaster \u2014 so much that Coulter herself dubbed it the \u201cAnn Coulter roast with Rob Lowe. \u201d Everyone gets burned. #LoweRoast @AnnCoulter pic. twitter.",
        "In 1949, Bettie Page moved to New York with aspirations of becoming an actress. It was there she met one of America\u2019s first \u2018fetish\u2019 photographers, Irving Klaw. From 1952 to 1957, Page worked as a model for Klaw for both his photographs and films, earning her the media nickname, \u201cThe Queen of Bondage. \u201d Klaw was targeted during the Kefauver Hearings of the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, in which his photographs were claimed to be causing deviance, perversion and violence. Klaw was not charged, but felt compelled to burn his prints and negatives upon returning to New York.",
        "There was a very weird thread worth picking out of Donald Trump\u2019s comments during NBC\u2019s \u201dCommander in Chief Forum\u201d on Wednesday night.",
        "It would be easy to describe Gary Johnson\u2019s appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201dMorning Joe\u201d on Thursday as having doomed his candidacy for president were it not for the fact that his candidacy was already doomed. The English language lacks a good way to describe something that was already in very bad shape and then, somehow, becomes far worse rather dramatically. Like if the Titanic had begun sinking but then blew up. Johnson was talking politics with the \u201dMorning Joe\u201d crew when regular guest Mike Barnicle shifted gears. \u201dWhat would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo?\u201d Barnicle asked.",
        "It was late July when voters last heard from the potential first lady of the United States. Melania Trump delivered her speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and then later stood with her husband, balloons dropping, waving to the crowd in what is starting to feel like a premature farewell to the campaign trail. Since then, she has not spoken publicly and has largely vanished from view, leaving a trail of questions and voids in her personal biography.",
        "Federal prosecutors will not attempt to retry former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, on corruption charges, ending a saga that rocked the commonwealth\u2019s political class and cut short the rise of a Republican Party star. The conclusion came unceremoniously, as prosecutors filed documents telling a federal appeals court they would move to dismiss the indictments. It means that the McDonnells \u2014 who have always maintained they did nothing illegal \u2014 will avoid criminal convictions and prison time.",
        "There are many better reasons to oppose Donald Trump than his rampant sexism. But the brazenness of Trump\u2019s recent comments, and the piling on by the Republican National Committee, demand some attention. The remarks are worth noting not only because of what they tell us about Trump & Co. but also because they illustrate some of the challenges that Hillary Clinton confronts as she seeks to become the nation\u2019s first female president, and that she would continue to face in office.",
        "Fifteen years after one of the most vivid and violent days in American history, there is still a debate over what the events of Sept. 11, 2001, actually mean. For some individuals, it is clear enough. They experience horrible, continuing and unrecoverable loss \u2014 the immense absence of friends and family chosen for death at random or led there by duty. But the place of these events in our national life remains disputed in a way that, say, Pearl Harbor was not. No one accused President Franklin D. Roosevelt of overreacting to the Imperial Japanese threat.",
        "If there has been one unifying theme to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s probably this: Throw the bums out. Unfortunately, that is not exactly a concrete set of policy proposals, nor is it a coherent governing philosophy. Despite what you may learn watching \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d you can\u2019t just fire your way to success. Still, Trump seems to think there is no problem that can\u2019t be solved through layoffs.",
        "\u201cU. S. investigates potential covert Russian plan to disrupt November elections. \u201d To those unused to this kind of story, I can imagine that headline, from The Post this week, seemed strange. A secret Russian plot to throw a U. S. election through a massive hack of the electoral system? It sounds like a thriller, or a movie starring Harrison Ford. In fact, the scenario under investigation has already taken place, in whole or in part, in other countries. Quite a bit of the story is already unfolding in public; strictly speaking, it\u2019s not \u201csecret\u201d or \u201ccovert\u201d at all.",
        "LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL nominee Gary Johnson embarrassed himself Thursday when he was asked about the epicenter of Syria\u2019s civil war and responded, \u201cWhat is Aleppo?\u201d The moment, on an MSNBC morning program, deserves to become iconic because it encapsulates why Mr. Johnson is not fit to be president. His disregard for U. S.",
        "GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER, Md. \u2014 NASA launched a spacecraft skyward Thursday evening on an ambitious voyage to intercept an asteroid more than 100 million miles from Earth, scoop up a piece of it and bring the sample home. Only once before has a spacecraft successfully completed such a mission, and never have astronomers attempted to gather such a large asteroid sample. The material that collects from its target, Bennu, is made of the same substances that were present at the beginning of the solar system.",
        "VIENTIANE, Laos \u2014 President Obama said he shook hands with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at a regional summit on Thursday, two days after canceling a bilateral meeting following Duterte\u2019s use of a profane epithet while criticizing about Obama. Obama played down a personal rift between the two and suggested the affair would not damage the alliance between the United States and the Philippines.",
        "U. S. authorities have arrested two North Carolina men accused of hacking into the private email accounts of U. S. intelligence officials. Andrew Otto Boggs, a. k. a. \u201cINCURSIO,\u201d 22, of North Wilkesboro, N. C. and Justin Gray Liverman, a. k. a. \u201cD3F4ULT,\u201d 24, of Morehead City, N. C. were arrested Thursday morning and will be extradited next week to Alexandria, where federal prosecutors for the Eastern District of Virginia have spent months building a case against a group that calls itself Crackas With Attitude.",
        "On Thursday morning, Sept. 8, Hillary Clinton held a good news conference. A podium in front of her campaign plane. Reporters asking her questions on camera. Give and take. The whole shebang. It was the first time she had done so since early December \u2014 a span of more than 270 days that led to an ongoing negative storyline about Clinton\u2019s lack of transparency and her standoffish relationship with the media. (There is some debate about whether Clinton broke her streak over the weekend on her plane.",
        "Iraq has long been an uncomfortable subject for Hillary Clinton. Her vote to authorize the war alienated progressives and arguably cost her the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. And now it\u2019s even being used against her by Donald Trump (who falsely claims to have opposed the war). So Clinton took a bold step Wednesday night when it comes to Iraq and neighboring Syria, where the battle against the Islamic State has been raging for 13 years. \u201dThey are not going to get ground troops,\u201d she said at a NBC forum. \u201dWe are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.",
        "VIENTIANE, Laos \u2014 President Obama struck back at Donald Trump on Thursday, repeating that the Republican presidential nominee is not qualified for office and warning that his \u201dunacceptable and outrageous\u201d behavior is becoming normalized in the 2016 election cycle. \u201dI don\u2019t think the guy\u2019s qualified to be president of the United States, and every time he speaks, that opinion is confirmed,\u201d Obama said at a news conference in Laos after a visit to this Southeast Asian nation.",
        "It was the the height of the civil rights movement. Police had beaten demonstrators on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. A bomb had exploded in a Birmingham church, killing four little black girls. Malcolm X had been assassinated. And every week, Americans watched a black woman on television. She was not a servant, but a lieutenant, fourth in command of a starship. Singer and actress Nichelle Nichols played the role of Lt. Nyota Uhura on \u201cStar Trek: The Original Series,\u201d which turned 50 on Thursday.",
        "When Colin Kaepernick kneels, you know where everybody else stands. Kaepernick\u2019s refusal to brace at attention for the national anthem has provoked a variety of sharply defined responses, from Megan Rapinoe\u2019s sympathetic bended knee to Bill Lynch\u2019s accusations of hijacking. But curiously, Kaepernick himself remains vague. In fact, when you think about it, those who have replied to Kaepernick have said more interesting things than the man himself. With the NFL opening its season this week, Kaepernick again will kneel, and no doubt others will too.",
        "After Apple\u2019s big announcement of the iPhone 7 lineup on Wednesday, there\u2019s probably one major question that\u2019s lingering in the minds of Apple fans: How will my life change without the iPhone headphone jack? To be clear, users will still be able to use their older headphones thanks to an adapter that will be included with every iPhone. But it will be an odd vestigial tail, either sticking out of their phones or on the end of their headphones.",
        "Stephen Strasburg left Wednesday night\u2019s game after getting one out in the third inning, a troubling turn of events for the who was activated from the disabled list before the game. Nationals Manager Dusty Baker said Strasburg felt a \u201cpinch in the back of his elbow,\u201d and would undergo an MRI exam Thursday. Below are tweets from our reporters at the press conference following his MRI: Nats athletic trainer Paul Lessard says MRI for Strasburg was clean regarding ligament. Has a \u201dflexor mass\u201d strain. \u2014 Barry Svrluga (@barrysvrluga) September 8, 2016 Lessard says it is \u201dnot a \u201d injury."
