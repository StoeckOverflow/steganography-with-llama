        "NEW DELHI \u2014 India\u2019s government has been on a public toilet building spree. Now, it\u2019s trying to shame people into using them. An aggressive new campaign ridicules those who are no longer poor but continue to defecate in the open \u2014 a practice that remains common in rural India despite its growing wealth and trappings of modern life. Television commercials and billboards now carry a message that strike at the heart of the Indian contradiction of being the world\u2019s major economy and also where relieving oneself in the open is the norm in most villages.",
        "A young girl shows her small horse in the family barn behind their house in Mount Hope, Ohio. Oftentimes, children are given livestock to train and raise as their own. (Michael Hanson) Documenting the cultures of people who produce food is a common thread in photojournalist Michael Hanson\u2019s work. While covering the Rick Santorum campaign in Ohio several years ago, Hanson\u2019s curiosity led him to an Amish family that ran a dairy farm. Photographing the Amish was difficult, as photography or pictures are not always welcomed in Amish communities. \u201cIt was a challenge to make these images.",
        "GENEVA \u2014 The United States and Russia agreed here Friday to the renewal of a in Syria, to begin Monday with the cessation of all air and ground attacks by all parties, including the government of Syrian President Bashar . If the truce holds for seven consecutive days and humanitarian aid begins to flow unimpeded to besieged areas, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the United States and Russia will then establish a \u201cJoint Implementation Center\u201d to coordinate their intelligence and air attacks against agreed terrorist targets in Syria.",
        "LONDON \u2014 The flow of foreign fighters to the ranks of the Islamic State \u2014 once a mighty current of thousands of radicalized men and women converging on Syrian and Iraqi battlefields from nations across the globe \u2014 has been cut to a trickle this year as the group\u2019s territory has shrunk and its ambitions have withered.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 With Election Day less than two months away, Democrats are increasingly worried that Hillary Clinton has not built a formidable lead against Donald Trump despite his historic weaknesses as a national party candidate. Even the Democratic nominee\u2019s advisers acknowledge that she must make changes, and quickly. Clinton leads Trump by a mere three percentage points, having fallen from her high of nine points in August, according to the latest Real Clear Politics average.",
        "When architect Gaver Nichols designed three houses on a next to his home in Alexandria more than 20 years ago, he had a Utopian idea of \u201cshared visual green space\u201d \u2014 a physical manifestation of the camaraderie for which the Del Ray neighborhood is known. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Over the years, owners of the three homes planted trees and shrubs, obstructing the view and carving semiprivate spaces out of the land.",
        "If you were to pick a handful of images that changed how people think about war, Nick Ut\u2019s most famous photograph would surely be among them. The image of Kim Phuc running from napalm \u2014 her skin burning, her clothes burned away \u2014 defined the horrors of the Vietnam War. Norwegian author Tom Egeland had the lasting power of Ut\u2019s work in mind when he shared the photo to Facebook weeks ago.",
        "The United States has had better weeks than the one just past. Only days away from the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates convened for what was dubbed the Forum, sponsored by NBC News and hosted by \u201cWhere in the world is Matt Lauer?\u201d Indeed. And then there was the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, whose spaceship apparently had just landed in the middle of Earth\u2019s 2016.",
        "\u201cA New York Times report sheds new light on the close ties between Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman and Kremlin cronies in Ukraine and elsewhere\u201d \u2014 the Atlantic, Aug. 15. \u201cU.

Good grief.

        "David L. Scheiner is an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Medical School. Eight years ago, I wrote a medical report on the health of candidate Barack Obama, whose personal physician I had been for 22 years. That report was 276 words and described Obama\u2019s health as excellent. I was derided for issuing such a brief report, but there was nothing of significance in the medical history of this healthy, male.",
        "Republican congressional leaders ardently want conservative members of the House to not force a vote on impeaching the IRS commissioner. The public does not care about John Koskinen\u2019s many misdeeds. And impeachment will distract attention from issues that interest the public. And because Democrats are not ingrates, the required of the Senate will never vote to convict Koskinen, whose behavior continues the pattern of doing what Democrats desire with the most intrusive and potentially punitive government agency. These Republican leaders\u2019 reasons are cumulatively unpersuasive. Resuscitating the impeachment power would contribute to revitalizing Congress\u2019s Article I powers.",
        "Muhamed Sacirbey was the first ambassador of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations and is a former Bosnian foreign minister. In 1995, he accompanied the Bosnian delegation to the Balkan peace negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, which brought a political settlement to the conflict in Bosnia. Syria\u2019s largest city is on the brink of starvation. Bombed from the skies and besieged on the ground, Aleppo\u2019s 2 million residents may soon be exterminated.

        "NORTH KOREA\u2019S fifth nuclear test, on Friday, its largest yet, prompted South Korea\u2019s president to describe North Korea\u2019s ruler, Kim Jong Un, as \u201cspiraling out of control. \u201d There\u2019s a basis for that: In defiance of mounting international sanctions, the Kim regime has now staged two nuclear tests in nine months, along with a steady stream of illegal missile launches. As South Korean leader Park put it, the young dictator \u201cis not listening to any words from the international community or neighboring countries in his attempt to cling to power.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 North Korea has taken a key step toward its goal of developing a missile capable of reaching the mainland United States, analysts said Friday after Kim Jong Un ordered yet another nuclear test. The test, which Pyongyang said was a \u201cnuclear warhead explosion,\u201d appeared to be North Korea\u2019s biggest yet. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear indication of progress towards developing a miniaturized nuclear warhead for North Korea\u2019s ballistic missiles,\u201d said Alison Evans, a North Korea analyst at IHS Markit, a consultancy.",
        "A federal judge ruled Friday against the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to halt construction on the Dakota Access crude oil pipeline that the tribe says endangers sacred burial grounds and could threaten its water supply from Lake Oahe, a dammed section of the Missouri river. But in a development that stunned even the tribe\u2019s lawyers, the decision by District Judge James E. Boasberg was effectively put on hold by a federal order to stop construction near the tribe\u2019s reservation until the Army Corps of Engineers can revisit its previous decisions in the disputed portion.",
        "Police said they found James Lee Acord and Rhonda L. Pasek overdosing in a Ford Explorer in East Liverpool, Ohio, on Wednesday, with a boy in the back seat.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, on Friday released 10 years\u2019 worth of tax returns to the media \u2014 revealing a modest family income, relative to the top of the Republican ticket, and reliable contributions to charity. The document release draws an uncomfortable contrast for the campaign: Trump himself has not released his tax returns, which he says he has been advised not to release because he is under audit. Critics have accused Trump of seeking to conceal his net worth or business practices. The Pence family\u2019s returns were straightforward.",
        "Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, sat for an interview with CNN Friday morning in which she became the latest prominent surrogate for the Republican presidential candidate to attempt a walk away from his long support of the disproved notion that President Obama was not born in the United States. Here\u2019s the case Conway made to CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo \u2014 courtesy of the invaluable Sopan Deb of CBS: Conway says to CNN that Trump believes Obama was born in the U. S. even though Trump himself has never said so. pic. twitter.",
        "Donald Trump claims that Hillary Clinton lacks \u201cthe strength or the stamina\u201d to run the country. He questioned in a tweet this week why the media was not covering a coughing fit she had at a rally in Cleveland. His party\u2019s chairman scolded her for not smiling enough. And Trump has insisted that the former senator and secretary of state does not resemble a commander in chief: \u201cI just don\u2019t think she has a presidential look.",
        "A direct reference to the sexual misconduct allegations against comedian Bill Cosby and acknowledgement that they have \u201cseverely damaged his reputation\u201d have been added to the entertainment gallery of the new National Museum of African American History and Culture. The museum, opening Sept. 24, came under fire last spring for its decision to include Cosby in its entertainment exhibition without noting that more than 50 women have accused him of rape, sexual assault or sexual harassment. He is expected to be tried next June for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting a former Temple University women\u2019s basketball official in 2004.",
        "Stefan Selig liked to travel in style. As he jetted around the world promoting American industry as one of the Obama administration\u2019s top trade officials, he told his staff to book him rooms at luxury hotels from South America to the Middle East \u2014 with hot tubs, rooftop decks and gourmet dining. He rode with services, spending $1, 800 during a trip to Boston last year. And when he stayed at hotels that were beneath his standards, Selig admonished his staff, complaining about \u201clousy\u201d accommodations.",

        "Arizona is one of five states with marijuana legalization on the ballot this fall, and the state\u2019s Republican governor, Doug Ducey, is not happy about it. Ducey urged voters last week to reject legalization, saying it would exacerbate the state\u2019s existing opioid problem. \u201dIf we want to expand this universe of people that are addicted and abusing drugs, well, you\u2019ll have that chance in November,\u201d he said at a news conference.",
        "WASHINGTON \u2014 Late in the morning of the Tuesday that changed everything, Lt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney was on a runway at Andrews Air Force Base and ready to fly. She had her hand on the throttle of an and she had her orders: Bring down United Airlines Flight 93. The day\u2019s fourth hijacked airliner seemed to be hurtling toward Washington. Penney, one of the first two combat pilots in the air that morning, was told to stop it. The one thing she didn\u2019t have as she roared into the crystalline sky was live ammunition. Or missiles.",
        "In October 1959, photographer William Claxton received an unusual call from Germany. On the other end was Berendt, a music writer, who had his heart set on doing a tour of America\u2019s jazz scene. He had seen Claxton\u2019s work, and felt his evocative photography would be the perfect counterpoint to his writing. The pair would start in New York City, hitting Memphis, Chicago, New Orleans, the West Coast, and many other places. By the end of the trip, they had captured the roots and heavyweights of American jazz, but also its fresh faces.",
        "Donald Trump was in a tuxedo, standing next to his award: a statue of a palm tree, as tall as a toddler. It was 2010, and Trump was being honored by a charity \u2014 the Palm Beach Police Foundation \u2014 for his \u201cselfless support\u201d of its cause. His support did not include any of his own money. Instead, Trump had found a way to give away somebody else\u2019s money and claim the credit for himself.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s claim at a fundraiser that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters fit into a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d prompted a swift and negative reaction Saturday from Republicans, including denunciations and calls for her to apologize. The comments echoed an accusation that Clinton had levied previously \u2014 that Trump appeals to and amplifies racist, xenophobic and viewpoints. But Clinton triggered a fresh controversy by claiming that \u201chalf\u201d of Trump\u2019s supporters fit that description.",
        "If Campaign 2016 needed some shorthand to capture the way many Americans see the competition between the two candidates, Hillary Clinton may have unintentionally supplied it this weekend. For much of the electorate, this could be remembered as a deplorable election. Candidates are often stamped by seemingly offhand statements. Mitt Romney never escaped his \u201c47 percent\u201d comment in 2012, and President Obama found the same when he said many culturally conservative voters \u201ccling\u201d to their guns and religion. Donald Trump has a laundry list of them. After Friday, Clinton now has hers to regret.",
        "Nine days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, President George W. Bush stood before Congress to outline a response to history\u2019s deadliest terrorist act: dramatic improvements in security at home and an assault against what he called a \u201cfringe form of Islamic extremism\u201d at war with the West. Fifteen years later, the first goal arguably has been met, as Americans by almost every measure are safer today from another attack than in 2001. Yet the struggle to defeat the global network of violent, rabidly jihadist groups has recorded fewer successes. Indeed, the problem appears to have grown bigger.",
        "When I was chief creative officer for Liz Claiborne Inc. I spent a good amount of time on the road hosting fashion shows to highlight our brands. Our team made a point of retaining models of various sizes, shapes and ages, because one of the missions of the shows was to educate audiences about how they could look their best. At a Q&A after one event in Nashville in 2010, a woman stood up, took off her jacket and said, with touching candor: \u201cTim, look at me. I\u2019m a box on top, a big, square box."
