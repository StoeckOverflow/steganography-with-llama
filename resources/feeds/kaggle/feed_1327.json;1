        "If Donald Trump is elected, he\u2019s promised to move quickly to suspend Muslim immigration, or maybe even stop people from entering the United States \u201cfrom any nation that has been compromised by terrorism. \u201d We\u2019ll withdraw from NATO unless all other members pay their fair share, either renegotiate or shred NAFTA and begin \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants to make sure they aren\u2019t sneaking in any \u201chostile attitudes toward our country or its principles.",
        "In the frequently contentious debate over Ground Zero, the Vesey Street stairs generated an especially heated conflict. For hundreds of workers who managed to escape the World Trade Center complex on Sept. 11, 2001, the two flights of stairs were a cherished symbol. The stairs had led them from the site\u2019s elevated plaza, away from the collapsing buildings and falling debris, to the relative safety of the streets beyond. In the words of one survivor, \u201cThey were the path to freedom. \u201d For preservationists, the stairs were also important artifacts: the last remnants of the World Trade Center.",
        "Apartment hunting in Philadelphia is already hectic enough. So relief washed over me when my girlfriend and I found a charming spot that worked for us. But before I was able to sign the lease, I received a call from the landlord, and he spoke slowly. He seemed concerned, and for good reason: After running a tenant screening on me using a service provided by the behemoth TransUnion, a clutch of criminal offenses appeared, including two felony firearms convictions.",
        "In a holding cell below New York City\u2019s Chinatown one night last year, I spent four hours curled in a ball, balancing on a narrow wooden bench. I was trying to avoid the freezing cinderblock walls and the cold cement floor, splattered with cigarette butts and rotten food. The NYPD had taken my shoes, in case I tried to hang myself with my laces. An hour earlier, I was quietly riding the A train home from a show in Brooklyn. My earbuds were plugged in, my feet propped on the seat in front of me.",
        "Hayley Tsukayama covers consumer technology for The Washington Post. Americans are estimated to check their smartphones a collective 8 billion times per day, and Nielsen says we spend an average of one hour and 39 minutes on our smartphones each day \u2014 up 60 percent from last year. But while many of us consider our smartphones to be an essential part of our lives, there are many misconceptions about how we use them and how they affect us. Myth No. 1 Smartphones give people cancer.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 The Syrian government embarked on a wave of intense airstrikes against areas Saturday, killing scores of people only hours after the announcement of a new deal between Russia and the United States. The attacks, which killed more than 80 people in the cities of Idlib and Aleppo, compounded skepticism expressed by the opposition that this deal will work where others have failed to end the war. The agreement was announced early Saturday in Geneva by Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after months of haggling over details.",
        "There is a debate within the Obama administration over whether to publicly blame Russia for the hack of the Democratic National Committee or to wait for the FBI to complete its investigation \u2014 a delay that has frustrated some lawmakers and national security officials. The intelligence community has high confidence that Russian intelligence services hacked the Democratic National Committee but does not have the same level of confidence that Russia then leaked stolen committee emails to the group WikiLeaks, several administration officials said.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 One of the gobs of jets zooming east across the Atlantic next week will carry a German finally alone with her thoughts, and the thoughts do figure to boom. When Angelique Kerber flew away last September, she hadn\u2019t gotten out of the third round of any 2015 Grand Slam. She was a regular who might drop by every now and then for a quarterfinal or semifinal. She disliked how she \u201cpushed\u201d her shots in a loss to Victoria Azarenka. Only the learned tennis intellectuals knew all that much about her.",
        "John W. Hinckley Jr. wearing a baseball cap and carrying a small bag, on Saturday afternoon stepped into his Williamsburg, Va. home \u2014 he can call it that now \u2014 12, 948 days after his attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan shook the country and prompted an enduring debate about crime and punishment.",
        "A white Indiana man gave police a novel explanation for why he drew his gun and threatened an unarmed black man before firing a shot: He was trying to help the intoxicated stranger get safely out of the street. Police didn\u2019t buy it, and now Bryan Oedzes is charged with aggravated discharge of a weapon in the village limits of Flossmoor, Ill. a Chicago suburb. He is also charged with a hate crime.",
        "WEST POINT, N. Y. \u2014 The top general at the U. S. Military Academy said that \u201cvalid concerns\u201d about separation of church and state were raised by people who questioned why the Army football coach asked a staff assistant to lead his team in prayer after an upset victory last week. The issue emerged after Coach Jeff Monken was shown in a video produced by West Point celebrating with his players and directing a member of his staff to lead a prayer after an upset victory Sept. 2 over Temple University.",
        "The past few weeks have brought a string of polls showing the presidential race tightening \u2014 first nationally, now in some key swing states. The most recent poll in every swing state, in fact, has Donald Trump within at least five points of Hillary Clinton. But one number buried inside a poll has to be particularly encouraging for Republicans: the generic ballot result. That question asks voters whether they, as of today, would vote for a generic Republican candidate or a generic Democratic candidate for Congress.",
        "The effects of gender and marital status on mortgages don\u2019t get a lot of research attention in real estate, but two new reports examine the exceptional role of single women in the marketplace and the challenges they face in getting a loan. A couple of highlights: \u25cfSingle women are statistically better at paying their mortgages than men \u2014 they default less often \u2014 yet they get charged more for their loans and are denied credit more often.",
        "By the time David and Vanessa Hall brought their autistic son to the hospital last week, the weighed just 88 pounds. David Hall told doctors at Longmont United Hospital in Longmont, Colo. that he thought his son was suffering from the flu and had lost 10 to 15 pounds in recent days. Doctors, however, quickly realized the teenager\u2019s condition was far more serious.",
        "One good analysis, I thought, deserves another. I recently compared CaliBurger, the imitator that opened in Columbia, to the famous chain out west. That exercise inevitably raised a question relevant to many more lovers: Which of the chains, Five Guys or produces the better griddle burger? I thought I\u2019d wander into these waters, knowing fully well that I\u2019d emerge with a million bite wounds. I mean, I realize this is a chump chore on many levels. Comparing one random (or in my case, many random) burgers from Five Guys to a few random burgers from makes no sense.",
        "THE CHALLENGE Michelle Guck and Ken Ward are trying to figure out how to best configure the area in their Crownsville, Md. home. They plan to use the space for entertaining and relaxing and would like a nautical look to tie into the view of the water from the glass doors. (Leah L. The Washington Post) THE SOLUTION Designer April Force Pardoe uses furniture to break up the large space and create separate zones for dining, conversation and watching television. (Interior Rendering by Rodney Storm for The Washington Post) PARDOE\u2019S SUGGESTIONS Sconces around the room complement the recessed lighting.",
        "Falling in love isn\u2019t something I planned on. Nonetheless, I woke up on a Sunday morning, and like everyone else in Washington, D. C. who forgot to make a brunch reservation, I headed to the Dupont Circle farmers market. It was midsummer. A Nile River of sweat was flowing from my hairline to the small of my back, but regardless I stepped into the line for iced coffee with the masses. Clutching my reusable shopping bag, sticky with sweat, I made eye contact with the bearded purveyor of locally sourced cold brew, the man of my dreams.",
        "On the first day of her first college photojournalism course, Erica Lusk was told to bring her camera for their next meeting. They would get comfortable with the cameras, get to know them, maybe even take them outside. That next class was on Sept. 11, 2001. It was during a break in that second class at the Corcoran School of the Arts & Design that the students who had gone outside for a breather ran back in, saying that people were running away from the White House. Security came and flushed the class into the street.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton fell ill during a memorial service marking the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, leaving abruptly and inserting new speculation about her health into a presidential campaign in which Republican Donald Trump has called her weak and unfit. Video of Clinton\u2019s hurried departure from the Ground Zero memorial showed her buckling and stumbling as she got into her van. Clinton\u2019s campaign issued a statement from her doctor later Sunday revealing that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier.",
        "Hillary Clinton falling ill Sunday morning at a memorial service on the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks will catapult questions about her health from the ranks of conservative conspiracy theory to perhaps the central debate in the presidential race over the coming days. \u201dSecretary Clinton attended the September 11th Commemoration Ceremony for just an hour and thirty minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen,\u201d spokesman Nick Merrill said.",
        "ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 Two police cruisers had just pulled up to the apartment building, their second visit of the day, but this time Diamond Reynolds barely bothered to look up. \u201cAlways something,\u201d said Diamond, 27, as she shoved the contents of her closet into a cardboard box. She had six hours left to move out or risk eviction. Her lease expired at 5 p. m. and the past several weeks had convinced her that East St. Paul was no longer a safe place to stay.",
        "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber\u2019s decision to bring taxis to the streets of Pittsburgh this week is raising alarms among a swath of safety experts who say that the technology is not nearly ready for prime time. The unprecedented experiment will launch even though Pennsylvania has yet to pass basic laws that permit the testing of cars or rules that would govern what would happen in a crash. Uber is also not required to pass along any data from its vehicles to regulators.",
        "Michael Morell was acting director and deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2010 to 2013. Mike Vickers was the undersecretary of defense for intelligence from 2011 to 2015. Both writers have served in Democratic and Republican administrations and endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Mr. Trump, with all due respect to you as the presidential nominee of the Republican Party, you cannot credibly serve as commander in chief if you embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader has repeatedly shown himself to be an adversary of the United States.",
        "After long and arduous negotiations, Israel and the Obama administration have agreed on a landmark military aid package that would increase U. S. aid to Israel over the next 10 years. But the White House is reluctant to sign the deal because officials are upset one leading lawmaker won\u2019t go along: Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.). The new agreement, which officials say would raise Israel\u2019s annual package of military aid from $3. 1 billion to $3.",
        "This is the inversion election, a contest in which so many of our familiar mental categories have been turned upside down. This year, it s the Republican presidential candidate who says the United States isn t great anymore and the Democrat who insists it is. The Republican says that the former KGB agent presiding over Russia is a better leader than the president of the United States. The Democrat condemns him for it. But last week reminded us that there is another role reversal in this election.",
        "Just because Donald Trump isn\u2019t qualified to be president \u2014 and just because much of his agenda is hateful and undesirable \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean that everything he says is automatically wrong. Some of his ideas deserve consideration and enactment. One of these is building a wall across our southern border with Mexico. It has been ridiculed as a monstrosity and a colossal waste of money. The theory of the wall is that it keeps out workers and, thereby, raises the wages of U. S. workers, including earlier Hispanic arrivals.",
        "Lawrence Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010. There is now a consensus that the United States should substantially raise its level of infrastructure investment. Economists and politicians of all persuasions are increasingly concluding that higher infrastructure investment can create quality jobs and provide economic stimulus without posing the risks of monetary policies in the short run.",
        "AMERICANS ARE burning record amounts of gasoline. The Energy Department announced Aug. 31 that the country fueled up more this June than in any other month the agency has measured, underscoring a finding last month that the United States is on track to set an annual gas consumption record in 2016. This was not supposed to happen. A couple of years ago, government experts projected that gasoline use would bump up about now \u2014 but not that it would hit or breach its 2007 peak.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 As the international community looks for new ways to punish North Korea for its latest nuclear test, one area is emerging as the next front to apply pressure: North Korea\u2019s practice of sending workers overseas to earn money for the regime. The United States and South Korea had already started quietly trying to persuade host countries to stop allowing in North Korean guest workers, according to people who work in both governments.",
        "SHARM Egypt \u2014 Clashes erupted in Libya\u2019s oil crescent on Sunday as fighters loyal to a powerful eastern military commander fought a rival militia aligned with the U.

Khalifa Hifter said his forces had seized control of Ras Lanuf and Sidra, among Libya\u2019s largest oil ports, and were fighting for control for Zuwaytinah."
