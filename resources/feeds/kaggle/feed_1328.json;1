        "Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019s children called the museum with an intriguing invitation. They had something they knew the National Museum of African American History and Culture wanted. So in January, curator Rex Ellis headed to Atlanta, slipped on a pair of white gloves, and carefully turned the pages of King\u2019s traveling Bible. The public last saw it during President Obama\u2019s second inauguration when it was borrowed from the family. \u201cIt was heavier than I thought it would be,\u201d remembers Ellis, the museum\u2019s associate director of curatorial affairs.",
        "In Jacksonville, Fla. football fans chanted \u201c !\u201d under a searing midday sun. In Kansas City, Mo. a lone, defiant fist punched the air. In Philadelphia, players helped hoist a massive flag \u2014 together \u2014 and in Seattle, a team locked arms \u2014 together. All across a nation, patriotism preceded pigskin Sunday, the opening weekend of the NFL\u2019s new season, and fans and players alike wrestled with the disparate, nuanced ideas of nationalism, dissent and loyalty \u2014 often all three at the same time.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 News of eight Chinese tourists spending more than $4, 000 at a Israeli hummus restaurant grabbed headlines last week. On Sunday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry launched a search for the group in an attempt to figure out why the tourists were charged so much.

A year and a half later, in an extraordinary twist, the two women have escaped back to the forest \u2014 taking just an ax, a machete and their pet birds. They left clothes they had been wearing strewn on a path \u2014 and their escape left a very clear message. We don\u2019t want your civilization.",
        "One in a series on the clothes that made a mark at New York Fashion Week. NEW YORK \u2014 Folks in the audience at the Christian Siriano show Saturday afternoon cheered his models. They were delighted by the diversity in both race and body shape. The designer has become one of Seventh Avenue\u2019s most vocal advocates for women, and he made sure that they were represented on his runway. As a cultural statement about inclusivity, Siriano\u2019s show was quietly eloquent. As a nod to the buying power of women, he made a smart business decision. Now to the clothes.",
        "WHITE PLAINS, N. Y. \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign will release additional medical records this week, a campaign aide said, bowing to growing criticism about how the campaign handled news of her pneumonia diagnosis. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be releasing additional medical information,\u201d Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said on MSNBC on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be releasing that to further put to rest any lingering concerns about what we saw yesterday.",
        "A spokeswoman for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, seeking to rebut criticism of the GOP nominee\u2019s history of charitable giving, said that Trump has given away \u201dtens of millions of dollars\u201d over his life. But spokeswoman Hope Hicks offered no details about that number, beyond saying that it included donations from the Donald J. Trump Foundation a charity that, despite its name, has been filled almost entirely with other people\u2019s money in recent years. Hicks also provided no information about how much if any of the donations she was describing had come from Trump\u2019s own pocket.",
        "ASHEVILLE, N. C. Donald Trump sought to keep the focus squarely on Hillary Clinton\u2019s comment that half of his supporters are a \u201dbasket of deplorables\u201d here Monday evening, charging his Democratic rival with running a \u201d campaign\u201d with \u201dno policy, no solutions and no new ideas.\u201d Trump spoke at an arena here where the atmosphere grew tense as protesters repeatedly interrupted his speech. Some of them made obscene gestures as they were removed from the premises. At one point, a man took a fighting stance and then pushed and grabbed male protesters and swatted at a female protester.",
        "Why does Donald Trump say such nice things about Vladimir Putin and Russia? What is Trump hiding in the tax returns he refuses to release? And are those two questions related? Voters should demand answers. Until we get them, we can only speculate about Trump\u2019s weird admiration for a strongman who presides over a system of autocratic cronyism, flouts international law with his territorial ambitions, works against U. S. interests in hot spots around the globe, and apparently might have even deployed computer hackers to meddle in our election.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 Hillary Clinton may have been unwise to say half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are racists and other \u201cdeplorables. \u201d But she wasn\u2019t wrong. If anything, when it comes to Trump\u2019s racist support, she might have the number. Trump, speaking to the National Guard Association of the United States\u2019 annual conference here Monday afternoon, proclaimed himself \u201cdeeply shocked and alarmed\u201d about Clinton putting half of his supporters in the \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d \u2014 as if anybody, especially Trump, could be shocked by anything this late in the campaign.",
        "Frank Luntz, the Republican political consultant, is a master of the political epigram. Under his tutelage, the estate tax became the death tax and global warming became climate change. So Luntz, once again going to the heart of the matter, recently put an question to a group of about 50 people: What would you rather see, Donald Trump\u2019s taxes or Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails? Upon that question hinges the election. Luntz was speaking to an gathering in the Hamptons.",
        "Elements of the American right are seized with a fashionable despair, employed as a operation. \u201cI think this will be the last election if I don\u2019t win,\u201d Donald Trump recently said. This is \u201cour last shot\u201d to save civilization, claims Gary Bauer. At stake are \u201cnational health and even survival\u201d according to Publius Decius Mus in an essay titled \u201cThe Flight 93 Election\u201d that is making the rounds among conservatives.

        "WE ARE not worried that Hillary Clinton is, as she jokingly put it on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show last month, \u201con the brink. \u201d Pneumonia can be a serious condition, but it is generally treatable, and Ms. Clinton appears to be getting good care. Even a would struggle to stay perfectly healthy on Ms. Clinton\u2019s grueling campaign schedule. We are instead worried about what we might not know about each presidential candidate\u2019s health \u2014 concerns that both of them have encouraged by a lack of transparency. Both campaigns are now promising to be more forthcoming.",
        "Move over, kale. The latest dietary craze is crow. A month ahead of Yom Kippur, statements of atonement, regret and contrition are flourishing. \u201cMistakes were made,\u201d it seems, and have been acknowledged by at least five actors in the past week \u2014 and in active voice, no less.

Last Tuesday, the company not only settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson for $20 million, but it also took the highly unusual \u2014 perhaps unprecedented \u2014 step of publicly acknowledging wrongdoing.",
        "BARROW, ALASKA \u2014 Here in the northernmost municipality of the United States, 320 miles above the Arctic Circle, people are facing the idea that they may soon be among the world\u2019s first refugees. Warming air, melting permafrost and rising sea levels are threatening their coastline, and researchers predict that by midcentury, the homes, schools and land around Barrow and its eight surrounding villages will be underwater.

        "During a fundraiser on Friday, Hillary Clinton repeated a theory about Donald Trump\u2019s supporters that has become widespread in the media a theory that divides them into two groups. Some of his supporters are motivated by bigotry and prejudice, Clinton said. The Democratic presidential nominee put this group into what she called \u201dthe basket of deplorables.\u201d Other supporters are motivated by broader frustrations about politics and the economy, Clinton added.",
        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Monday accused the Federal Reserve of keeping interest rates low for political reasons, the latest in a string of often contradictory critiques of the nation\u2019s central bank. The Fed vehemently defends the setting of its influential interest rate as independent of political considerations \u2014 a principle that is considered fundamental not only to the Fed but for central banks around the world. Yet speaking on CNBC, Trump said Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen should be \u201cashamed\u201d of keeping interest rates so low for so long.",

        "BEIRUT \u2014 A U. S. and agreement that went into effect Monday was almost immediately violated, diluting hopes for an imminent halt to the relentless violence that has raged for the past five years and raising new questions about U.

        "The symbolism was obvious: A rich presidential candidate turns a mothballed government relic into a palatial hotel steps away from the White House. But for Donald Trump, not one for subtlety, even that wasn\u2019t enough. It had to be \u201cone of the great hotels of the world. \u201d When Trump International Hotel Washington, D.

        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 President Obama implored Americans on Tuesday to consider the gravity of the presidential election eight weeks away, calling Republican Donald Trump a dangerous fraud who has no real idea of what it means to be president.

        "Americans and the poor enjoyed their best year of economic improvement in decades in 2015, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday, a spike that broke a streak of disappointment for American workers but did not fully repair the damage inflicted by the Great Recession. Real median household income was $56, 500 in 2015, the bureau reported, up from $53, 700 in 2014. That 5. 2 percent increase was the largest, in percentage terms, recorded by the bureau since it began tracking median income statistics in the 1960s. In addition, the poverty rate fell by 1."
