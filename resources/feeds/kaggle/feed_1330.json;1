        "BACK AT the start of this year, Republican leaders were full of promises that Congress could overcome inaction and partisan stalemate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said, \u201cSome thought the Senate could never be cured of its dysfunction and its gridlock. . . . We believed the Senate could be restored to a place of high purpose again. \u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) declared, \u201cWe need to raise our gaze. \u201d Well, gentlemen, it is now September, a dangerous virus has hit U. S. shores, and all Congress has contributed so far is bickering.",
        "The survival rate for prostate cancer is 99 percent after 10 years, regardless of whether men undergo surgery, radiation or are \u201dactively monitored,\u201d according to studies published Wednesday. Researchers hailed the results as good news, saying they had been expecting a survival rate of 90 percent. The two new studies, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, also illustrated the complicated treatment equations facing men with prostate cancer, and they immediately set off a debate among physicians about how to interpret the results.",
        "U. S. intelligence agencies are expanding spying operations against Russia on a greater scale than at any time since the end of the Cold War, U. S. officials said. The mobilization involves clandestine CIA operatives, National Security Agency cyberespionage capabilities, satellite systems and other intelligence assets, officials said, describing a shift in resources across spy services that had previously diverted attention from Russia to focus on terrorist threats and U. S. war zones. U. S. officials said the moves are part of an effort to rebuild U. S.",

Trump Foundation \u2014 to buy a portrait of himself during a fundraiser auction at his Club in Florida. That purchase was reported Sunday by The Washington Post.

        "No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio. If history is any guide \u2014 which it only is sometimes \u2014 Donald Trump woke up to good news Wednesday morning. A new Bloomberg poll, conducted by Selzer & Co. puts him up by five points in the state. Trump leads because he holds big margins with his traditional base: He leads Hillary Clinton by 23 points among white women without a college degree, by 27 points among white men and by 43 points among white men without a college degree.",
        "Mitt Romney had just lost the 2012 presidential election, and a group of wealthy donors assembled in New York\u2019s University Club was trying to figure out what had gone wrong. Suddenly, a young woman stood up before the largely male crowd and delivered an unsparing critique of the Republican\u2019s technology and canvassing operations. Thomas Saunders III, chairman of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Board of Trustees, was impressed. \u201cWho is that?\u201d he asked the man next him. Soon, there would be few in conservative policy and political circles who did not know the name Rebekah Mercer.",
        "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The SUV meandered through a quiet neighborhood until it reached Harry Reid\u2019s former home, a pleasant ranch house with a roof, pink flowers out front and a swimming pool in the back. The Senate minority leader remained in his seat, flipping the window up and down to take it all in. \u201cMy wife wanted to make sure I told you: This house is crap,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we lived there, it was really nice. You\u2019ll see, they ruined our house.",
        "The Atlantic Coast Conference announced Wednesday that it will move its championships scheduled for this academic year out of North Carolina in response to the controversial state law House Bill 2, which forbids people from using a restroom different from the gender on their birth certificate in government buildings and prevents localities from enforcing policies.

        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Prosecutors on Wednesday announced new charges against Brazil\u2019s most prominent politician, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, accusing him of controlling a corruption ring centered on state oil company Petrobras. \u201cLula was the commander of the scheme,\u201d prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol said at a news conference.

        "NEW YORK \u2014 Federal prosecutors have launched an inquiry into aggressive sales tactics at Wells Fargo after revelations that thousands of its employees secretly created accounts customers didn\u2019t ask for to meet sales goals, according to people familiar with the matter.

        "Inside a metal shed in the Tibetan highlands of western China, thousands of microprocessors flank narrow corridors, generating a constant hum and stifling waves of heat. Outside, the sky is clear and blue, with a mountain peak looming at the top of a narrow wooded valley. A flock of goats ambles idly past a pile of discarded foam packaging. Inside, though, tranquility is transformed into clamor. Red, blue and green lights constantly flash; cooling water trickles down the walls, and large ventilation fans thrum as they struggle to shift the hot air produced by all this concentrated computing power.",
        "CANTON, Ohio \u2014 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said in an interview here that he remains unwilling to say that President Obama is born in the United States, that he is more bullish than ever on his chances to win and that he is not exploring the launch of a new media company in case he loses the race.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump unveiled a scaled back tax plan on Thursday, which is projected to add less to the federal debt but also to deliver fewer benefits to taxpayers than his original proposal.

        "It was hours before Sen. Hillary Clinton would vote in 2002 on whether to give President George W. Bush the authority to go to war with Iraq.

        "Hours after reaching an agreement on Syria last Friday with Secretary of State John F. Kerry and clearing the final deal with Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov wandered the halls of their meeting venue in Geneva, waiting for Kerry to get the okay from Washington.

        "If Democrats want to beat Donald Trump, they need to get past the freakout stage and get to work. In a sane and just world, this presidential race would be a walkover. Commentators would already be sketching out their postmortem analyses of an Hillary Clinton victory. Pare the contest down to its essentials: A former senator and secretary of state, eminently qualified to be president, is running against a dangerous demagogue who has never held public office and should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. Ought to be case closed. But it\u2019s not.",

Policy Toward North Korea, which was sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations.

        "When Donald Trump unveiled his proposal this week, he made a claim that seemed absurd on its face. He said Hillary Clinton \u201chas no plan. \u201d He repeated the charge on his website, carping that Clinton \u201cclaims she wants to cap a family\u2019s child care expense at 10 percent of income, but provides no details. \u201d Journalists and Clinton sympathizers called the statement crazy, noting that Clinton released a bold, detailed policy ages ago.",
        "If you are the status quo candidate in a change election in which the national mood is sour and of the electorate think the country is on the wrong track, what do you do? Attack. Relentlessly. Paint your opponent as extremist, volatile, clueless, unfit, dangerous. Indeed, Hillary Clinton\u2019s latest national ad, featuring major Republican politicians echoing that indictment of Donald Trump, ends thus: \u201cUnfit. Dangerous. Even for Republicans. \u201d That was the theme of Clinton\u2019s famous \u201c \u201d speech and of much of her $100 million worth of ads. Problem is, it\u2019s not working.",
        "Once upon a time, I thought the repudiation of white supremacists was the easiest layup in U. S. politics. Not for the Trump campaign. Asked recently whether he considered former KKK leader David Duke deplorable, Republican nominee Mike Pence said he was \u201cnot in the business. \u201d Earlier this year, Donald Trump was posed a similar question and claimed, incredibly and repeatedly, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about David Duke. \u201d In a particularly revealing campaign moment, Trump was asked to repudiate the death threats made by some of his followers against a reporter.",
        "A BASIC precept of international law is that sovereign nations, or their government officials, should not be liable for official actions in the civil courts of other sovereign nations. Sovereign immunity has stood the test of time because it makes practical sense.
