        "The Drug Enforcement Administration has received a torrent of backlash from patients with chronic pain and former opiate users after announcing plans to ban kratom, a plant gaining popularity across the United States for its effects. Kratom, which originates in Southeast Asia, has become more widespread in the United States in the past decade, fueled by online testimonials from users and a lack of federal regulation. Advocates say the plant \u2014 typically crushed and mixed or brewed with water \u2014 poses few health risks while helping users relieve severe pain and overcome addictions to powerful prescription painkillers.",
        "In comments to a local Philadelphia radio station Wednesday, Donald Trump Jr. argued that the media was ignoring Hillary Clinton\u2019s lies and distortions, and that if his father did the same thing, it would be \u201dwarming up the gas chamber.\u201d \u201cThe media has been her surrogate in this. Without the media, this wouldn\u2019t even be a contest. But the media has built her up. They\u2019ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy [sic] on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing,\u201d Trump Jr. said.",
        "When we say the Donald Trump campaign has a volatile relationship with \u201dthe media,\u201d we\u2019re generally talking about The Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN, Politico and other news agencies that scrutinize his policies and rhetoric. We\u2019re not talking about Cosmopolitan magazine, a publication that describes its focus as \u201dfun, fearless advice on men, love and sex, plus hot style trends and beauty secrets.\u201d Or at least, we weren\u2019t until this week, when Ivanka Trump, the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s daughter, became irritated with the \u201dnegativity\u201d in a Cosmo reporter\u2019s questions and abruptly ended a telephone interview Wednesday.",
        "Donald Trump has often insisted that he is a that he won\u2019t attack an opponent until he is attacked first. This isn\u2019t true, of course; Trump has often gone after opponents, political and otherwise, without provocation. But it\u2019s certainly true that he likes to throw punches at people who he thinks have slighted him \u2014 even if they aren\u2019t in the political ring with him. That has gotten him into trouble, such as when he attacked the wife of Khizr Khan following her husband\u2019s speech at the Democratic National Convention, a decision that did him no good electorally.",
        "The Navy\u2019s Blue Angels stunt team will stop performing the aerial maneuver that a pilot attempted during a fatal crash in June and implement a variety of other changes after an investigation found the pilot\u2019s errors caused the crash, Navy officials said Thursday. Marine Capt. Jeffrey Kuss, 32, was killed June 2 near Smyrna, Tenn. while preparing for the Great Tennessee Air Show.",
        "What is it about tipping that makes the process so fraught? Whether it\u2019s confusion about what\u2019s appropriate, guilt that you might not be leaving enough cash or just fuzzy math, there\u2019s no part of the dining experience that creates more debate. Making matters even more complicated, the rules change depending on where you go and what you order. How much should you tip at a spot? And what happens when you get comped a drink? We talked to restaurant and bar insiders to get their perspectives on how to handle a variety of situations.",
        "As America endured the drab years of the Great Depression, Amelia Earhart\u2019s exploits were a bright spot. She broke gender barriers by completing solo flights most male pilots hadn\u2019t accomplished and traveled the country speaking of women\u2019s empowerment and the glorious promise of air travel. Then, she vanished. Her mysterious disappearance over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 has vexed historians and fueled conspiracy theories for decades. Earhart was declared dead after the U. S.",
        "Photographer Bruce Davidson was shooting scenes of urban poverty on East 100th Street in New York, when a woman asked him why he was there. When he said he was shooting images of the ghetto, she responded, \u201cWhat you call a ghetto, I call my home. \u201d Davidson, a member of the Magnum Photos collective, worked hard to balance the dire situations that residents lived in with moments of beauty and resilience. It was also a common thread throughout his life\u2019s work. No matter the situation, Davidson\u2019s subjects maintained their inalienable right, as humans, to dignity.",
        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday acknowledged for the first time that President Obama was born in the United States, ending his long history of stoking unfounded doubts about the nation\u2019s first African American president but also seeking to falsely blame Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for starting the rumors. \u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean,\u201d Trump said Friday morning at his newly opened luxury hotel in Washington. \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.",
        "Donald Trump said \u201cJump,\u201d and TV news said \u201cHow high?\u201d It happened again Friday morning when the Republican presidential candidate held the media hostage for nearly an hour after promising a major news announcement. \u201cBreaking News: Trump To Make \u2018Big Announcement\u2019 on Birther Issue,\u201d said the banner on MSNBC. \u201cSoon: Trump To Address Birther Issue,\u201d said CNN\u2019s banner. Fox News was, of course, along for the ride. While they waited, and waited, Trump provided what amounted to a campaign infomercial and shamelessly promoted his new Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington.",
        "For Oscar Garza, career success was measured one account at a time. The Chase personal banker said he had a month to persuade customers to open 40 checking or savings accounts and 15 credit cards. Meeting that goal would mean an extra $800, but failure could lead to his termination. \u201cYou either do this or you\u2019re out,\u201d Garza said. The stakes were so high, Garza says, that his managers encouraged him to enter false income information or to accept questionable identification documents in order to speed approval for new accounts.",
        "JONESVILLE, La. \u2014 Sunday sermons had just ended when residents of this river town learned that a lone black gunman had killed three police officers in Baton Rouge. Before the news could sink in, a profane message appeared on Facebook. \u201cHey Mr. president,\u201d it began. \u201cWhen are you going to grow a pair. And tell it like it is. These are terrorist. That have declared war on my brother. (White police officers) enough is enough. \u201d The author was Skylar Dore, Jonesville\u2019s white chief of police. The post instantly cleaved the community in two.",
        "Is Laura Bush trying to tell us something? For months now, most of her family \u2014 in a drastic break with tradition \u2014 has been resolutely quiet on the 2016 presidential race. The Bushes have been at the forefront of Republican politics for nearly four decades, but after Jeb Bush dropped out of the GOP nomination race, they have declined to endorse Donald Trump and mostly stayed out of the news. But who was Laura Bush hanging out with in Washington this week? Some establishment Republicans on Capitol Hill in need of a reelection boost?",
        "At long last, Donald Trump has set himself free. At a highly choreographed event Friday, the Republican nominee for president of the United States finally issued his verdict on the birthright of our president, who, it turns out, is a real American! \u201cBarack Obama was born in the United States. Period,\u201d Trump intoned to the great relief of no one. Well, . Welcome to planet Earth, son. But Trump\u2019s announcement was merely a curtain call on a theatrical production otherwise known as Free Publicity for Trump.",
        "\u201cWhere the hell is the outrage?\u201d The answer to that question depends on who\u2019s doing the asking. If it comes from D. C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier, who\u2019s retiring to become head of security for the National Football League, you can guess \u2014 correctly \u2014 that she\u2019s referring to the city\u2019s system, which she described in a recent interview as \u201cbeyond broken\u201d and responsible for releasing repeat offenders into the community. If the question comes from San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, however, it could be directed at the actions of the same D. C.",
        "American voters have received, we are told, all they are going to get from their presidential candidates in the way of medical information. In light of Hillary Clinton\u2019s initially (and, if she had her way, permanently) undisclosed pneumonia, in light of Donald Trump\u2019s unhealthy body mass index and buffoonish physician, in light of both candidates\u2019 relatively advanced ages, this admonition is unsettling and unsatisfying. Experts have raised reasonable questions about Clinton\u2019s medical care and history, including her record of blood clots and the use of the blood thinner Coumadin to treat them.",
        "GLENOLDEN, Pa. From Erie in the west to Scranton in the east, Pennsylvania is flecked with casualties the stubborn economic sluggishness and relentless globalization have inflicted on industrial communities. But in this Philadelphia suburb, Tom Danzi knows that the economy is denting even his business repairing damaged cars. His Suburban Collision Specialists once had 27 employees kept busy by drivers stimulating the economy by producing fender benders. Now he has only 17.

        "IN THE digital age, it is easy for everyone to make themselves heard on the Web  \u201d even terrorists. After a summer of   attacks, the question for policymakers and the tech industry has been how to change that. A better question would be when and whether companies should be taking extremist content off the Internet at all.  At a forum this month",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 The recent spate of embarrassing emails and other records stolen by Russian hackers is President Vladimir Putin\u2019s splashy response to years of what he sees as U.

Putin is seeking revenge and respect, and trying to reassert Russia\u2019s lost superpower status at a time of waning economic clout and an upcoming Russian election, according to interviews with specialists here and, in Washington, with a senior U.

        "The Obama administration has agreed to pay nearly $3 million to the family of an Italian aid worker who was killed in a CIA drone strike in Pakistan last year, but it has yet to reach a settlement with relatives of an American who was also killed in the attack, U. S. officials said.",
        "A U. S. airstrike this month killed a senior Islamic State militant who oversaw the group\u2019s information and propaganda activities, the Pentagon said Friday.

        "The Drug Enforcement Administration has said it will ban the kratom plant for two years because it can produce effects similar to opiates. Although it\u2019s been used for centuries in Southeast Asia, its use is relatively new in the United States, spurred in large part by users sharing reports of their experiences with the drug on online forums. One of the most of those forums is the website Erowid. org, an \u201donline encyclopedia of psychoactive substances,\u201d whose founders were profiled in the New Yorker last year.",
        "Donald Trump listened skeptically as his labor consultant bragged in early 1981 about connections to New York\u2019s underworld. Daniel Sullivan, who dealt with labor problems at Trump\u2019s construction sites, was a giant of a man with great charm and a criminal record. He told Trump he was tight not only with leaders of unions, some of them fronts for the mob, but also with the FBI. Trump was dubious. \u201cHe was . . . a big storyteller,\u201d Trump recently told The Washington Post. \u201cHe portrayed himself to be the closest person on earth to the FBI.",
        "The main problem with trying to predict how an election is going to go is that it\u2019s largely unpredictable. Sure, there are trends in the polls and, sure, there are overarching indicators like the health of the economy and the favorability rating of the sitting president, but literally anything can happen at any moment that upends things. Such things usually don\u2019t happen, of course; trends and history tend to be pretty good guides. But this is 2016, an election in which 30 percent of the things that have happened have been things that no one could possibly have anticipated.",

        "Robert Morin had his quirks: a regular breakfast of Fritos and a Coke; a refusal to give up on the 1992 Plymouth that he drove to his job as a library cataloger; the span, from 1979 to 1997, during which he watched more than 22, 000 movies \u2014 an average of about three a day. Morin read in chronological order every book published in the United States between 1930 and 1938, excepting only textbooks, children\u2019s books and cookbooks.
