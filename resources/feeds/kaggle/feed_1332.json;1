        "The U. S. deal to bring peace to Syria seemed near collapse late Saturday, as the two countries publicly accused each other of and atrocities in the wake of an apparently mistaken U. S. airstrike that killed dozens of Syrian soldiers. The U. S. Central Command acknowledged the strike, in eastern Syria\u2019s Deir province, saying it was \u201chalted immediately\u201d when U.

        "Oprah Winfrey donated $21 million to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. She has also served on its board from the museum\u2019s earliest days. Its theater bears her name. This is a passion project for Winfrey, who feels deeply connected to history. She spoke by phone to The Washington Post Magazine.

After greetings, Winfrey jumped right into the conversation: I haven\u2019t been more excited about anything, ever, since \u201cThe Color Purple. \u201d . ..",
        "In March, Taylor Swift posted some photos from her trip to an undisclosed tropical location with Calvin Harris. One caption read, \u201cThat time we finally took a vacation. \u201d This summer, Swift went on another jaunt with a new boyfriend and a group of girlfriends. Elle covered the resulting hijinks with a piece titled, \u201cThat Time Cara Delevingne Scared he Sh*t out of Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston. \u201d The expressions \u201cthat time I\u201d and \u201cthat time when\u201d have bubbled up all over the Internet, in headlines, in promotions and on social media.",
        "Last weekend, a woman was standing outside a Valentino store in Manhattan when, as she later told police, she felt heat on her left side. Her blouse was on fire, and a man stood nearby with a lighter in his hand. The woman, whose name has not been released by the New York Police Department, escaped with a hole in her blouse and no injuries. The NYPD is investigating the incident as a possible hate crime \u2014 the woman is Muslim, and she was wearing a hijab.",
        "The first of three planned presidential debates will take place at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N. Y. on Sept. 26. Maybe it\u2019s good the debate is slated for a gym. If Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are really serious about proving their physical vigor and stamina, they can do laps in the arena while they answer questions. Clinton, of course, had to leave a commemoration in New York early last Sunday, suffering from dehydration and a case of pneumonia.",
        "August tied July as the hottest month on record, according to NASA data released this past week. This year we\u2019ve seen half a dozen floods, along with epic droughts. Mother Nature is telling us there\u2019s a problem. The trend lines are clear. Yet we have a Republican presidential nominee who has repeatedly called climate change a \u201choax. \u201d \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s a minor effect,\u201d Donald Trump told The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board, \u201cbut I\u2019m not a big believer in climate change. \u201d So it goes in the madhouse of the climate debate.",
        "For some people, losing belief in God is as easy as taking off a sweater that\u2019s grown too tight. There\u2019s a sense of relief and freedom. But when I became an atheist, that\u2019s not how I felt at all. Losing God was like watching my best friend die. When I was a kid, Jesus was my best friend. That sounds hokey \u2014 the kind of phrase someone might drop while giving you a sales pitch on being \u201cborn again\u201d \u2014 but I mean it literally.",
        "When Secretary of State John F. Kerry traveled to Chile in October to attend an international conference on ocean preservation, he carried something that had nothing to do with environmental collaboration. The computer disk he brought contained 282 records on Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s role in a brazen act of international terrorism in Washington, D. C. The car bombing in Sheridan Circle that occurred 40 years ago this week took the lives of former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier and his colleague Ronni Karpen Moffitt. Kerry personally handed the disk of documents to Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 Even by the standards of strange tales that come out of North Korea, this one is particularly bizarre. Did Kim Jong Il\u2019s regime order the abduction of an American in 2004 so his children could learn English? Did North Korean agents, with the help of Chinese officials, snatch a student who had been hiking near the border with Burma? Yes, or at least probably, if his parents, a South Korean abductees\u2019 advocate and human rights proponents are to be believed. No, if you\u2019re talking to American officials.",
        "Donald Trump Jr. says things. Lots of things. Sometimes, they are problematic things: At least twice this week he was forced to defend an action or remark viewed as racially or culturally insensitive. [Watch: What is the ?] Of course, not all of the remarks were initially his own words: He has often stumbled based on his social media decisions \u2014 the people he retweets and the messages he amplifies.",
        "Donald Trump has prided himself on having unerring instincts and a flair for showmanship, attributes that helped dispatch his Republican rivals in the primaries and that he hopes will land him in the White House in January. His handling of the birther issue \u2014 past and present \u2014 says just the opposite. Trump\u2019s performance Friday was a hurried and defensive effort to put to bed a lingering controversy that was suddenly resurrected because of his own stubbornness \u2014 and his unwillingness to acknowledge error or express regret.",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 The race for Senate here in Illinois is contentious and potentially historic. Both Republican incumbent Sen. Mark Kirk and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, are physically disabled and often use a wheelchair. Kirk suffered a massive stroke in 2012; his left side is partially paralyzed. Duckworth lost both her legs and partial use of her right arm in 2004 after the Black Hawk helicopter she was piloting in Iraq was shot down.",
        "LONDON \u2014 \u201cBrexit means Brexit. \u201d So said Theresa May over and over and over this summer as she vaulted herself out of the political wreckage of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and into the nation\u2019s top job. But two months after May took the keys to 10 Downing Street as her predecessor sped away without glancing back, Britain is none the wiser as to what \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d actually means.",

        "In a town that once took considerable pride in its Confederate past, the Alexandria City Council voted unanimously Saturday to change the name of Jefferson Davis Highway and seek permission from the Virginia General Assembly to move a renowned statue of a Confederate soldier in historic Old Town. The council\u2019s actions went beyond the recommendations of a task force that studied what to do about the city\u2019s controversial Confederate symbols, but not as far as some residents wanted.",

        "Within minutes of meeting my Bumble date at a bike race, he demanded that I take off my sunglasses so he could see my eyes. I obliged. In the two hours we were together, he proceeded to put his hand firmly on my butt, pretending to usher me through a crowd. He also did not ask before reaching over to rub my shoulders, as though he had a right to touch my body. As a feminist writer, I understand that these behaviors denote male entitlement and indicate that he might not respect women. And yet, I was turned on.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Authorities are investigating three incidents \u2014 explosions in New York and New Jersey and a stabbing attack in Minnesota \u2014 that took place within a period on Saturday and sowed fears of terrorism.

        "Lagging support among Hispanic voters for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and congressional candidates in crucial races has stoked deep concern that the party and the presidential campaign are doing too little to galvanize a key constituency. While Clinton holds a significant lead over Republican rival Donald Trump in every poll of Hispanic voters, less clear is whether these voters will turn out in numbers that Democrats are counting on to win. Clinton trails President Obama s 2012 performance in several \u00c2 states, including Florida, Nevada, Colorado and Arizona.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s effort to end the controversy he helped stoke over President Obama\u2019s citizenship has handed Democrats a fresh opportunity to motivate voters, particularly African Americans, who are offended by an issue that had faded to the recesses of the campaign. Black lawmakers, who listened to Obama gleefully mock the Republican nominee\u2019s evolving views on his birth certificate during a gala dinner Saturday night, plan to take their condemnation of Trump on the road in the coming weeks. Democrats are already fundraising off the issue. They seized on the topic during the Sunday talk shows.",

        "Spiro Agnew is remembered for pleading no contest to charges related to bribery and resigning as Richard Nixon\u2019s vice president. But his signal political achievement was igniting a campaign that endured for more than four decades painting the mainstream media as biased, liberal and elitist. sentiment had long been bubbling on the right when Agnew targeted what were then the Big Three television networks for representing \u201ca concentration of power over American public opinion unknown in history.",
        "In the great American debate about Syria, there has been an intervention by Vladi mir Putin \u2014 and it has made Barack Obama the loser. Since 2012, Obama has been stubbornly arguing that there is no workable option for even a limited U. S. intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war. John F. Kerry, Hillary Clinton, David Petraeus and Leon E. Panetta, among others, pushed the president to use U. S.",
        "The betting is that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t raise interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, its key policymaking body. There are already complaints that the Fed, which cut rates to near zero in late 2008, is waiting too long to reverse low rates. Last December, the Fed increased rates by a quarter of a percentage point. It hasn\u2019t done anything since. \u201cThe Fed will make a major mistake if it doesn\u2019t raise rates,\u201d says economist Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe job market is strong and very close to full employment.",
        "Japan\u2019s new defense minister, Tomomi Inada, is pushing her country to become a stronger, more independent actor on the world stage \u2014 and trying to make herself prime minister in the process. But as she gets closer to both goals, she\u2019s finding that Japan\u2019s success is more dependent than ever on deepening cooperation with its neighbors and the United States.

        "OVER THE summer, we asked readers to submit topics on which they would like to see Post editorials. We got more than 1, 000 submissions. We cut those down to 10 and asked readers to vote on them. The top was the following: \u201cWhether young Americans should be required incentivized to spend a period of time in a program of national service. \u201d Our answer: Required, no.

        "THE UNITED Nations General Assembly will hold its first meeting Wednesday on the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance \u2014 the tendency of bacteria to fight back against antibiotics. This is a rare example of the world body devoting time to a issue, and though concrete results may be a long way off, the event itself suggests a stirring awareness that it is a global threat. Antibiotics were truly \u201cwonder drugs\u201d when created in the middle of the 20th century, and they became a pillar of modern medicine."
