        "BEIRUT \u2014 A U. S. deal for Syria was on the brink of collapse Sunday after a week of mishaps and setbacks that exposed the fragility of the plan. The is premised on a series of exercises that were intended to culminate Monday in the launch of preparations between the United States and Russia for joint airstrikes against terrorist groups in Syria. Instead, the violence ticked up Sunday, promised deliveries of aid failed to materialize and an errant strike Saturday by the U. S.",
        "It is beyond dispute that Donald Trump has the momentum in the presidential race. It is also beyond dispute that he still has an in cred ibly narrow path to get to 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. Let\u2019s start with the two most important numbers in this election: 18 and 13. Eighteen is the number of states every Democratic presidential nominee has carried in each of the past six presidential elections, dating to 1992. Add in the District of Columbia, which also fits the bill, and you get 242 electoral votes.",
        "JAKE TAPPER: \u201cWell, just as a point of fact, again, Donald Trump did not accept when Barack Obama released his birth certificate in 2011. He kept up this whole birther thing until Friday. That\u2019s five years. But we only have a little time left. So, I want to ask you \u2026 \u201d GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE ( . J.): \u201cNo, but, Jake, that\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s not true that he kept it up for five years. \u201d TAPPER: \u201cSure, he did. \u201d CHRISTIE: \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true. \u201d TAPPER: \u201cIt is true.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 It was billed as part of a rebooted Clinton campaign pitch to millennials \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( .) stumping at two Ohio universities not long after Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) did the same. Warren, who entered politics after decades as a popular economics writer and academic, spent the first 10 minutes of her speech retelling the history of liberal economics since 1932, from the Great Depression to the civil rights era.",
        "There were helmets thrown in frustration on the field and faces buried in disappointment in the locker room. What was expected to be a promising season for the Washington Redskins has been anything but in their first two games. The latest loss, a defeat at the hands of the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday at FedEx Field, dropped Washington to for the first time in Jay Gruden\u2019s three seasons as the team\u2019s coach. Winless teams after Week 2 have historically struggled to make the playoffs: Since 2006, just nine of the 86 teams (10.",
        "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 The guerrillas summoned Camilo G\u00f3mez to the jungle on Dec. 24, ruining his Christmas. It was 2001, and G\u00f3mez was the Colombian government\u2019s chief negotiator in failing peace talks with the rebels. He grudgingly said goodbye to his family in Bogota and went to meet with the two most powerful men in the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. As usual, he went alone, like an envoy from a foreign nation. The Marxist rebel army was near the height of its power then, dominating a third of the country with nearly 20, 000 fighters.",
        "GAZA CITY \u2014 Fathi Hammad said that he is pleased to be named a \u201cglobal terrorist\u201d by the United States. On Friday, the State Department branded the senior Hamas leader a \u201cspecially designated global terrorist. \u201d That is a rarefied list of international enemies belonging to organizations such as Boko Haram, Hezbollah, the Taliban, the Jewish Kahane group, Algerian Salafists, the Islamic State and Hamas, among others. On Saturday, Hammad told The Washington Post: \u201cThe decision only makes me more confident about my path. The threat of killing or arrest? It doesn\u2019t freak me out, not at all.",
        "A former Kansas State University student has apologized for a Snapchat image that went viral, with many sharing it on social media as a symbol of racism on campus. [\u2018Racially offensive\u2019 Snapchat sparks outrage at Kansas State] Paige Shoemaker, who was a student at Kansas State at the time, said she and her friend Sadie Meier, who is not a Kansas State student, had put on a clay cosmetic facial mask and were Snapchatting with a friend who is black. \u201cHe had made a joke about us \u2018being black\u2019 now,\u201d Shoemaker wrote in a text message.",
        "Federal prosecutors weighed Tuesday additional charges linked to the bombings in New York and New Jersey, even as investigators sifted through surveillance video and other clues seeking to determine whether the lone suspect \u2014 now in a New Jersey hospital bed \u2014 had wider links in plotting the attacks. A day after a shootout with police that ended in the arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, there were no signs that the probe had expanded to other possible suspects or groups.",

        "NEW YORK \u2014 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton warned Monday that rhetoric by opponent Donald Trump is \u201cgiving aid and comfort\u201d to the Islamic State as both candidates sought to position themselves as better qualified to combat terrorism in the aftermath of a spate of violence over the weekend. \u201cWe know that a lot of the rhetoric that we\u2019ve heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists, including ISIS, because they are looking to make this a war against Islam,\u201d Clinton said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.",
        "In the event of a victory by Donald Trump in November, political analysis will take on a forensic cast. How did establishment politics \u2014 first in the GOP primaries, then in a national electorate \u2014 come to die? Privately, Democrats would regret their selection of one of the most joyless, least visionary presidential candidates in recent memory. Publicly, they would blame trends that incubated within the Republican coalition, particularly a nativism incited by conservative media and carried by a candidate \u2014 alternately cynical and frightening \u2014 who is unbound by truth, consistency or decency.",
        "So, Donald Trump thought he\u2019d have a little fun this weekend with the idea of Hillary Clinton being assassinated. The Republican presidential nominee suggested that, because Clinton favors restrictions on guns, her security detail should be disarmed. \u201cTake their guns away,\u201d he proposed. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens to her. \u201d There was a time when fantasizing aloud about the murder of your opponent would have been beyond the pale \u2014 but not anymore. \u201cAbsolutely nonsense,\u201d Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, told ABC News when asked if such a message could incite violence.",
        "July and August were the hottest months for the planet since record keeping began. Scientists are confident that 2016 will be the hottest year. Rising sea levels have made flooding commonplace in several major U. S. cities. And meanwhile, one of our leading presidential candidates says climate change is some kind of Chinese hoax. Elections have consequences, and this is one of the most fateful: Anyone who takes climate change seriously had better do everything possible to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.",
        "Around the country, colleges have found a new excuse for shutting down free speech: safety. Just as \u201cnational security\u201d has periodically served as a pretext for robbing Americans of civil liberties, so too has \u201ccampus security\u201d newly become a convenient rationale for discarding commitments to free speech. Unwilling to either defend controversial speech or cop to censoring it, college administrators are instead increasingly invoking public \u201csafety\u201d when they cancel events. Ben Shapiro, a young conservative firebrand who has criticized Black Lives Matter, has recently been disinvited from two college campuses due to \u201csecurity\u201d concerns.",

        "Prosecutors on Monday said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was told about a politically motivated scheme that shut down the nation\u2019s busiest bridge as it was happening, the first time officials have alleged in court that Christie knew about the plot as it was going on. The assertion came during the \u201cBridgegate\u201d trial of two of Christie\u2019s former aides, whom prosecutors accuse of hatching a plan to create a mammoth traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge to retaliate against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for not supporting Christie\u2019s reelection bid.",
        "The desk clerk at the Trump International Hotel seems to sense grand opportunities in my arrival. \u201cWould you give me the opportunity to escort you to your room?\u201d she asks me at . And then, a few minutes later, \u201cWould you give me the opportunity to enter your room?\u201d She says she recently came to the United States from Afghanistan, and she is excited about the opening of the hotel because she loves being around people.",
        "Federal officials say they intend to aggressively shape the emergence of driverless cars, increasing their role well beyond the traditional recalls of cars when they prove defective. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx spelled out that determination Monday in issuing a policy paper that details 15 points he expects automakers to comply with as they rush to put autonomous cars on the road.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 At least a dozen humanitarian aid workers, and an unknown number of civilians, were killed Monday in an airstrike on a convoy delivering assistance west of Aleppo that the Obama administration said was likely launched by the Syrian government or Russia. \u201cWe know it was an airstrike, and not one from the coalition. We don\u2019t know if it was Russia or the regime,\u201d the only others flying over Syria, a senior administration official said. \u201cIn either case, the Russians have a responsibility certainly to avoid doing it themselves, but also to keep restraint on the regime.",
        "Saudi Arabia appears to be using U. S. white phosphorus munitions in its war in Yemen, based on images and videos posted to social media, raising concerns among human rights groups that the highly incendiary material could be used against civilians. Under U. S. regulations, white phosphorus sold to other countries is to be used only for signaling to other troops and creating smoke screens. When the munition explodes, it releases white phosphorus that automatically ignites in the air and creates a thick white smoke.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 President Obama is approaching the final weeks of the presidential campaign with an intense sense of urgency and concern amid a growing realization that the election could be determined by the narrowest of margins. Earlier this year, Obama seemed to regard the defeat of GOP nominee Donald Trump as a near inevitability, but in recent days the president has changed his tone.",
        "KENT, Ohio \u2014 The crowd to see Bernie Sanders filled half of a college gym. Hundreds of millennials who still proudly wore their Bernie shirts listened to the senator from Vermont insist, as a nearby sign said, that he was \u201cBerning for her. \u201d He\u2019d always told them not to trust the media; now he was telling them not to listen when people attacked the Democratic nominee. \u201cHillary Clinton and I believe that women should control their own bodies,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHillary Clinton and I believe that our gay brothers and sisters deserve the right to get married.",
        "This weekend, the head of the Republican Party suggested that he might punish the fellow 2016 presidential candidates who don\u2019t support Donald Trump, possibly by making it harder \u2014 or even impossible \u2014 for them to run for president down the line. That\u2019s a pretty unusual thing for a party leader to say, but it\u2019s not clear how the Republican Party could carry out this threat without changing Republicans\u2019 nominating process in equally unusual ways.",
        "Two years ago, top officials at the Federal Reserve mapped out a strategy for withdrawing the central bank\u2019s unprecedented support for the American economy. The official communiqu\u00e9 was titled \u201cPolicy Normalization Principles and Plans,\u201d and it was supposed to serve as a rough outline for the tenure of newly installed Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen. Essentially, it consisted of two basic parts: Raise interest rates and shrink the central bank\u2019s massive balance sheet. But now, both of those steps are being called into question as Fed officials grapple with an economy that appears to be stuck in first gear.",
        "The scientists briefly known as Den Volokin and Lark ReLlez thought they had found something big. It was not data wrung from a clever experiment or a lucky field observation. Instead, the pair had constructed a model, a mathematical argument, for calculating the average surface temperature of a rocky planet. Using just two factors \u2014 electromagnetic radiation beamed by the sun into the atmosphere and the atmospheric pressure at a planet\u2019s surface \u2014 the scientists could predict a planet\u2019s temperature. The physical principle, they said, was similar to the way that air ignites fuel in a diesel engine.",
        "A teenager who was caught on video in a sexual act with a girl was sentenced to probation and will probably not have to spend another day behind bars. Iowa District Judge Randy Degeest last week gave Kraigen Grooms a suspended sentence after the pleaded guilty to engaging in a lascivious act with a child, a Class C felony. Grooms, who will be on probation for five years and who has been in jail since his arrest in 2014, will not have to spend another day in custody unless he violates the terms of his probation.",

        "Donald Trump spent more than a dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire\u2019s businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. Those cases, which together used $258, 000 from Trump\u2019s charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against \u201c \u201d \u2014 which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses. In one case, from 2007, Trump\u2019s Club faced $120, 000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla. resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole."
