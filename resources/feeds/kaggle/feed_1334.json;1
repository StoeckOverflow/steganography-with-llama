        "The fight for control of Congress is about to get louder and more expensive. A late infusion of big money is allowing congressional super PACs to ratchet up their spending in the final weeks before Election Day, financing an air war that will inundate voters in key states, according to campaign finance reports filed Tuesday. On the right, Las Vegas Sands chief executive Sheldon Adelson and other wealthy Republican contributors swelled the coffers of the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC that raised more in August than it had in the entire 2016 election cycle.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Federal authorities said Tuesday that the man accused of carrying out bombings here and in New Jersey over the weekend hoped to stage a suicide attack and worried he would be captured first.

        "The sculpture was packed in bubble wrap inside a box and was wheeled on a dolly to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial one day last month by three people who looked to be in their 60s. They asked Al Gallant, a volunteer guide, if it was okay to leave a memento. Sure, he said. They pushed the cart down the path to the Wall, took the sculpture from the box, and walked away. One of them paused to snap a picture as they departed. What they had left was an unusual piece \u2014 \u201cmacabre,\u201d Gallant called it.",
        "Wells Fargo\u2019s longtime chief executive John Stumpf endured more than two hours of pummeling Tuesday on Capitol Hill over a scheme in which bank employees created millions of sham accounts to meet aggressive sales goals. \u201cI have often said that banking is based on trust and that trust was broken at Wells Fargo,\u201d Sen. Richard C. Shelby ( .) chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said during the hearing.

Norman Eisen, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama from 2009 to 2011. As government ethics lawyers who have, respectively, counseled the most recent Republican president and the most recent Democratic one, we have watched Donald Trump\u2019s campaign with increasing concern.

        "CREDIT WHERE credit is due: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has improved his proposals for fiscal policy. Whereas he previously backed $9. 25 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years, with no plausible way to pay for them, last week he offered a revised version that would cost less than half that, $4. 4 trillion, with no plausible way to pay for it. In other words, his prescriptions have progressed from preposterous to merely intellectually dishonest; their foreseeable impact on the U. S. economy, from destabilizing to merely dangerous. Of the tax cuts Mr.",

        "This story has been updated. It\u2019s one of the great \u2014 and unresolved \u2014 debates of Antarctic science. In 1984, a team of Ohio State University researchers reported a surprising fossil find: More than a mile above sea level, in Antarctica\u2019s freezing Transantarctic mountain range, fossilized deposits of tiny marine organisms called diatoms were found in rock layers dated to the Pliocene era, some 2 to 5 million years ago.

As an elementary school lunchroom staffer, her job was to work the register for the children when they paid for their meals. But the boy had a negative balance on his account, and a new policy in the Pa. school district this year prevents cafeteria workers from serving a hot meal to students who owe more than $25. Koltiska said she had to follow the policy and was ordered to refuse the boy his hot meal because he couldn\u2019t pay for it.",
        "It\u2019s hard now to remember a time before Brangelina, or to even think of them as they were then, circa 2004. He was already a pretty big deal, and so was she: two solid occupying equal but separate swaths of the celebrity stratosphere. Then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie got together, and something happened. The tabloids lost their minds, obviously \u2014 and they each, magically, became bigger, better, more elevated versions of their selves. Pitt, who had coasted through so many films on his charm, became a formidable producer, lauded for his mature, nuanced acting chops.",

        "Like it or not, the decision we make in this November\u2019s election will be a choice on behalf of the entire world. How we vote will determine whether the forces of democracy, openness and religious tolerance remain strong, or whether our country throws in its lot with tribalism, prejudice and authoritarianism. This sounds like melodrama. It isn\u2019t.

        "Impeachment is among the most severe and solemn powers Congress has, right up there with declaring war. Not since 1876 has an   appointee been impeached, and not in the history of the republic has Congress impeached an   official below the Cabinet level.  Now, Republicans in Congress would change that. On Wednesday, they wheeled out the sacred tool of impeachment  \u201d weeks before an election  \u201d for the purpose of smearing an honorable public servant, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, in service of a lie.",
        "Who\u2019s to blame for the fact that November is just around the corner and Donald Trump is within shouting distance of electoral victory? The media, of course. Journalistic institutions stand accused of facilitating Trump\u2019s rise, through reportorial lassitude or outright connivance with him for the sake of ratings. The scapegoating reached its reductio ad absurdum in a recent blog post by Paul Krugman of the New York Times, who labeled the media \u201cobjectively \u201d for allegedly ganging up on Hillary Clinton like a \u201chigh school clique bullying a nerdy classmate because it\u2019s the cool thing to do.",
        "WHERE DID Donald Trump get the harebrained idea that he will get Mexico to pay for a new border wall? Or his boast that he will make Arab states pay for refugee safe zones in Syria? Perhaps from the success he has had sleazily diverting money other people had donated to charity into paying off his business obligations. \u201cIt\u2019s called OPM. I do that all the time in business. It\u2019s called other people\u2019s money,\u201d Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like doing things with other people\u2019s money.",
        "Two days after police in Oklahoma released video that shows a white Tulsa police officer fatally shooting an unarmed black man, members of the slain man\u2019s family pushed back against lingering suggestions that Terence Crutcher was a dangerous and erratic individual who posed a serious threat to the officers who encountered him.
