        "Tesla and Chevrolet are locked in a fierce battle for consumers who\u2019ve never considered an electric vehicle before. Previous generations of EVs lacked range and performance, but both companies say their forthcoming vehicles will be capable of going more than 200 miles on a single charge. Even though EVs account for 1 percent or less of new vehicle sales, automakers like Tesla and Chevy are hoping the arrival of a car that can go with gas guzzlers will change that equation. I had an opportunity to the Chevy Bolt on Tuesday.",
        "Enrique Acevedo anchors the national newscast for Univision, the TV network. On Tuesday night, Acevedo finished the broadcast at midnight at the network\u2019s studios in Doral, Fla. near the Miami airport. But he didn\u2019t go home. He had a reservation. \u201dI used points,\u201d Acevedo said in a telephone interview, meaning American Express reward points. \u201dI didn\u2019t want to \u2026 spend any money on Trump\u2019s property, so I used points.\u201d Acevedo was headed to Trump National Doral Miami, a large golf resort owned by the GOP nominee, which was just a few blocks from the Univision studios.",
        "Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, sat down for an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Tuesday to talk about the state of the campaign. It got a little weird.

        "A series of bills before Congress this month is the surest sign yet that Saudi Arabia can no longer claim the privileged status it has held largely unchallenged for decades in Washington. As the fight over terrorism escalates, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are taking aim at the longtime U. S. ally with a of legislative rebukes to the Kingdom over its alleged ties to extremists and military campaigns in Yemen. The first came Wednesday, when the Senate voted on a resolution to restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia until it stops targeting civilians in Yemen.",
        "Before dinner on July 29, Carter Roberts of Chesterfield, Va. seemed perfectly healthy. That evening, he vomited. When he woke up the next morning with a slight fever of 99 degrees, his mother, Robin Roberts, figured that he was coming down with a cold. The next morning, she found him collapsed on his bedroom floor. \u201cMommy,\u201d she recalls him saying. \u201cHelp me, help me. \u201d Carter could barely stand when she picked him up, and his neck was arched backward. \u201cWhat was most alarming,\u201d she said, \u201cis he had no control over his right arm whatsoever.",
        "Summer heat has overstayed its welcome for many in September. But if you\u2019re looking forward to cooler weather, Thursday\u2019s autumnal equinox is a reminder that fall is finally on our doorstep. The 2016 fall equinox arrives Sept. 22 at 10:21 a. m. Eastern. What happens on the equinox \u2014 and why are day and night not quite equal? Check out these five questions (and answers) to learn more. 1. What happens on the equinox? Like the spring equinox in March, the autumnal equinox marks an astronomical turning point of the seasons.",
        "CHARLOTTE \u2014 Even as this city reels from a deadly police shooting that triggered intense, violent demonstrations, the city\u2019s police chief said Thursday that officials had no plans to release video of that encounter, despite calls from civic leaders for more transparency. Authorities facing some of the most intense reactions seen in more than two years of protests over policing nationwide vowed a strong law enforcement response to the unrest, declaring a state of emergency after two nights of chaos on the streets here.",
        "Two senior Democratic lawmakers with access to classified intelligence on Thursday accused Russia of \u201cmaking a serious and concerted effort to influence the U. S. election,\u201d a charge that appeared aimed at putting pressure on the Obama administration to confront Moscow. The jointly issued statement from Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam B. Schiff \u2014 Californians who are the ranking Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence committees, respectively \u2014 described recent cyber penetrations of the Democratic National Committee and other U. S. political entities as intrusions that were likely directed by Russian President Vladi mir Putin.",
        "Yahoo on Thursday reported the largest data breach in history affecting at least 500 million user accounts months after first detecting signs of an intrusion that the company blamed on \u201d \u201d hackers. The web giant called on customers to change their passwords and institute other protective measures, but the largest fallout could be for Yahoo itself. The company this summer agreed to sell its core business for $4. 8 billion to telecommunications giant Verizon in a deal now clouded by news of the massive breach.",
        "In advance of the upcoming presidential debates, we gave Post readers a chance to play moderator. We received more than 3, 200 submissions, almost all thoughtful and sincere. They touched on matters from personal character to potable water, from what the candidates see as the biggest mistake in the nation\u2019s history to their understanding of patriotism. There was no starker gap than that between questions directed only at Donald Trump and those directed only at Hillary Clinton. About 60 percent of questions were asked of both candidates.",
        "If you are a black man in America, exercising your constitutional right to keep and bear arms can be fatal. You might think the National Rifle Association and its amen chorus would be outraged, but apparently they believe Second Amendment rights are for whites only. In reaching that conclusion I am accepting, for the sake of argument, the account given by the Charlotte police of how they came to fatally shoot Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday. Scott\u2019s killing prompted two nights of violent protests that led North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) to declare a state of emergency.",
        "Of all the absurdities in Donald Trump\u2019s rapid political rise, none is more puzzling than his reputation for toughness in the war against terrorism. Trump is a developer who takes any domestic terrorist attack \u2014 whatever the actual circumstances \u2014 as confirmation of his views on a lax immigration system, as evidence of a system hobbled by political correctness and as cause for more aggressive profiling of Muslims, Arabs or whomever he is currently defining as the threat. Some of his followers seem particularly pleased when he edges toward declaring Islam itself to be the enemy.",
        "Sherrilyn Ifill is the president and of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \u201cThat looks like a bad dude. \u201d This was the assessment of a Tulsa police officer of motorist Terence Crutcher as he walked toward his stalled vehicle. It was made from a police helicopter hundreds of feet in the air. All that could be seen clearly was that Crutcher was an African American man with his hands in the air. Seconds later, officers used a Taser on Crutcher; less than five seconds later, an officer shot and killed him.",
        "Millennials are souring on Hillary Clinton. Again. Not that they were ever so sweet on her to begin with, at least relative to how they swooned over other Democrats. Both Bernie Sanders in the recent primary campaign, and Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 general elections, received far more love from young voters. But in any case, Clinton\u2019s already weak millennial support has gotten much weaker in the past month. Still, there\u2019s good reason to believe they\u2019ll come around, even if they do so grudgingly. First, the data.",
        "It\u2019s the annual gathering of world leaders in New York this week, and for most of them, it\u2019s time for group therapy. Around the globe, leaders of all stripes seem afflicted with the same malady: low approval ratings. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Ruchir Sharma has pointed out that the median approval rating for the leaders of the top 20 emerging and developing economies has dropped by 17 points over the past decade. What is going on? Sharma argues that the cause is economic. Global growth has slowed from a War II average of 3. 5 percent to 2 percent since 2008.",
        "Complaints of sexual harassment in the National Park Service have spread to Yosemite and Yellowstone, two of the crown jewels in the system, lawmakers disclosed Thursday as they berated a top agency manager for failing to punish wrongdoers. At a hearing awash in denunciations by unified Democrats and Republicans that sexual misconduct is not taken seriously, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz ( ) said 18 employees at Yosemite National Park have come forward with allegations of harassment, bullying, and a hostile work environment.",
        "HARLOW, England \u2014 He went down with a single punch. Arkadiusz J\u00f3\u017awik \u2014 shy, devoted to his mother and an immigrant to Britain from his native Poland \u2014 was out with friends late last month enjoying pizza and drinks when they were set upon by a group of teens, some reportedly shouting slurs. The punch knocked J\u00f3\u017awik to the ground, the back of his head slapping the concrete of the rundown pedestrian plaza in this hardscrabble London suburb. The was taken off of life support days later.",
        "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Donald Trump has amplified his focus this week on a strident nationalist and message, emphasizing rhetoric that has fueled his popularity among white voters but which also threatens to antagonize the centrists likely to decide the November election. In speeches and interviews in recent days, Trump has called for \u201cAmerican hands\u201d to remake the country rather than those of foreigners. He has portrayed Syrian refugees as a cultural threat, not just a security risk.",
        "A group of 75 retired career Foreign Service officers, including ambassadors and senior State Department officials under Republican and Democratic presidents over nearly a has signed an open letter calling Donald Trump \u201centirely unqualified to serve as President and . \u201d The diplomats said \u201cnone of us\u201d will vote for Trump. While they said not all of them agreed with every decision made by Hillary Clinton, they said they all supported her candidacy.",
        "\u201cWhy aren\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\u201d Hillary Clinton asked rhetorically on Wednesday, echoing a question she surely gets all the time \u2014 and perhaps legitimately wonders herself. It\u2019s a question that seems to come up over and over again among Americans: How, given all of the things \u2014 they would argue racist and sexist \u2014 that Donald Trump has said, is this race as close as it seems? How has an experienced politician like Clinton not buried her opponent by now?",
        "The blob is one of the biggest and most mysterious objects in our universe. Discovered 16 years ago by researchers at Cal Tech\u2019s Palomar Observatory, the gargantuan object glows 10 times bigger than the Milky Way. At first, the scientists thought the blob in their data was a fluke. Then they identified more of the mysterious blotches and realized they\u2019d detected something new: glowing clouds of hydrogen gas 11. 5 billion light years from Earth.",
        "Humanity was born in Africa. But at some point, many of our ancestors left. The question of when and how they bid farewell to the continent remains a subject of some debate: A mass exodus occurred roughly 60, 000 years ago, according to DNA and fossil evidence, but signs point to some migration much earlier than then. In a trio of studies published Wednesday in Nature, researchers attempt to trace the origin of our species by looking to neglected DNA \u2014 populations that haven\u2019t been studied as extensively as large European and Asian ethnic groups.",
        "JENNINGS, La. \u2014 For a state accustomed to explosive sex scandals, the one dominating a U. S. Senate race here simmered for a long time before boiling over into public view last week. In a new book, \u201cMurder in the Bayou,\u201d author Ethan Brown cites multiple anonymous sources who claim that Rep. Charles W. Boustany Jr. a top Republican candidate for the Senate race, had been the client of three prostitutes who were later murdered.",
        "That bottle doesn\u2019t have water in it. Or Ga tor ade. Or anything you might want to chug down. There is, instead, pickle juice: briny and sour with seeds floating to the top, acidic enough to sting the back of your throat and make you reevaluate the decision to drink it. Thirsty? Not anymore. And yet football teams nationwide \u2014 from high schools into the college and professional ranks \u2014 are keeping pickle juice on their benches and in their cafeterias to ward off cramps and fight dehydration, regardless of the lack of science demonstrating its efficacy.",
        "CHARLOTTE \u2014 The wife of a man fatally shot by police recorded cellphone video of the encounter that includes her pleading with officers not to shoot and begging her husband to get out of his truck. The video footage was the first glimpse of what happened before and after a shooting that has inflamed this city and prompted intense, sometimes violent protests over the past three days. The recording does not include a view of the shooting itself, which occurred Tuesday afternoon as Keith Lamont Scott, a black man, was sitting in his parked vehicle outside his apartment.",
        "For several years now, as demonstrators across the country have poured into the streets, there has been little doubt about their chief motivation: Outrage over the killings of unarmed black Americans at the hands of law enforcement agencies. But Rep. Robert Pittenger ( . C.) isn\u2019t buying it. A white American male born in 1948, the lawmaker says he understands the motivations of young, African American protesters better than they do.",
        "The first presidential debate of the general election is often the most treacherous \u2014 especially for the candidate who steps on stage with the presumed advantage. Which is why Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, the one in that position this time around, knows not to take anything for granted. Monday\u2019s faceoff at Hofstra University on Long Island is projected to have the biggest audience ever for politics\u2019 equivalent of the NBA playoffs, with estimates that upward of 100 million people will be watching.",
        "The real Hillary Clinton \u2014 the funny, kind, passionate woman her friends and colleagues insist actually exists \u2014 has been missing from public view for so long that even some of her most admiring defenders wonder whether she will ever emerge again. On the eve of the first presidential debate, Clinton\u2019s campaign is launching a drive to convince voters that she is, well, human.",
        "Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign on Friday, the latest chapter in a rocky relationship between the two men that has ricocheted from fawning support to searing personal insults to, now, a kind of detente. In a Facebook message posted Friday, Cruz said he has had \u201dareas of significant disagreement\u201d with Trump, but cannot allow Hillary Clinton to become president."
