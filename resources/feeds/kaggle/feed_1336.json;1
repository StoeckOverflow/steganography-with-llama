        "\u201cThis is a story that is too big to be in the hands of one community,\u201d said Lonnie Bunch. \u201cIt really is the story that has shaped us all. \u201d That story is that of African Americans. And on this weekend of the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) the seventh episode of \u201cCape Up\u201d is my conversation with its founding director Lonnie Bunch.",
        "This weekend, Washington is the place to be \u2014 to see and be seen \u2014 at the opening of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture. years from now, there will be no African American in the United States who was not in this city on Saturday, Sept. 24, 2016. Just as 53 years after the event, there are no African Americans who did not participate in the 1963 March on Washington. And, yes, there is no adult African American male alive who was not on hand for the Million Man March in 1995.",
        "On July 20, Ted Cruz left the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland with a radiant conscience on his arm. Its umbrella gleamed and its little shone brightly. The honeymoon lasted 65 days. \u201cVote your conscience,\u201d Cruz had urged, that third night of the Republican National Convention, prompting loud boos from a crowd that had been planning to vote for Donald Trump instead. His conscience had gazed riveted at him, seeing a side to the man that it had never seen before. The next few days were paradise.",
        "It\u2019s here, at last. The showdown we\u2019ve all been waiting for: Hillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump. For what seems like years now, we\u2019ve been building up to this moment \u2014 the ultimate battle of the sexes. The first woman vs. the last man. For days, talking heads and pundits have been telling us what to look for. (Ink on Clinton\u2019s palm? Small receivers planted in Trump\u2019s hair?) Moderator Lester Holt has released his topics for Monday night \u2014 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Direction,\u201d \u201cAchieving Prosperity\u201d and \u201cSecuring America\u201d \u2014 throwing Twitter into a tizzy of tart translations.",
        "AURORA, Colo. Here on the High Plains, where the deer and the antelope once played, Denver\u2019s suburbs roam toward the Rockies\u2019 front range and the nature of today\u2019s polyglot politics is written in the local congressman\u2019s campaign schedule. One day last week, Republican Mike Coffman went from a Hispanic charter school in a strip mall, to another strip mall for lunch at an Ethiopian restaurant with leaders of the Ethio pian American community, then to a meeting with the editor of the largest of two newspapers serving more than 3, 000 Korean Americans in the metropolitan area.",
        "Especially in an election year, federal employees make a tempting target. They are, in the popular imagining, entitled and entrenched, unresponsive to the public for whom they work and uninterested in anything but collecting a paycheck and a cushy pension. You never hear the phrase \u201cbureaucrats in Washington\u201d in a sentence that ends on a positive note. The antidote to this unwarranted and corrosive derision arrives every year in the form of the Partnership for Public Service and its Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals.",
        "President Obama on Friday vetoed legislation that would allow families of victims to sue Saudi Arabia over its alleged ties to the terrorists who carried out the attacks. Congressional leaders plan to hold override votes in the coming days and supporters of the legislation say they are confident they can succeed in overturning the president\u2019s action. It would be the first time during Obama\u2019s presidency that Congress has overridden a veto. The legislation would allow U. S. courts to waive claims to foreign sovereign immunity in cases involving terrorism on U. S. soil.",
        "Corey Lewandowski is set to be paid nearly half a million dollars by Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign by the end of the year, with almost a quarter of his compensation coming after the controversial political operative was ousted in June as campaign manager. Lewandowski, who is now a paid commentator on CNN, collected at least $415, 000 in salary, bonuses and severance from the Trump campaign between April 2015 and August of this year, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal campaign finance filings.",
        "Nobody knows for certain who will win on Nov. 8 \u2014 but one man is pretty sure: Professor Allan Lichtman, who has correctly predicted every presidential election since 1984. When we sat down in May, he explained how he comes to a decision. Lichtman\u2019s prediction isn\u2019t based on polls, shifting demographics or his own political opinions. Rather, he uses a system of statements he calls the \u201dKeys to the White House\u201d to determine his predicted winner. And this year, he says, Donald Trump is the favorite to win.",
        "The American men walked into the darkened brothel in Bangkok and were soon offered a variety of prostitutes, young and old, male and female. \u201cYou go in and try to look like a john as much as possible,\u201d one of the Americans said later of his undercover role. \u201cTry to act like them, talk like them. You don\u2019t go in and order a glass of milk. \u201d The men moved from brothel to brothel, each \u201cpacked with foreigners,\u201d the American said. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting next to these perverts, not only having to interact with them but become one of them.",
        "The plan was simple: Order a pizza, rob whoever showed up to deliver the pie. But the caper did not go as the four men expected. That was because Napoleon Harris III, arrived with the pizza in hand. Harris is a man of many hats. Not only has he served as an Illinois state senator since 2013, he is the owner of two Beggars Pizza franchises. One of which, in Harvey, Ill. received a call just before closing time on Sept. 6. Harris is also 6 feet 3 inches tall, and weighs 250 pounds.",
        "U. S. forces are using white phosphorus munitions in their fight against the Islamic State based on pictures and videos posted online by the Pentagon, but it is unclear exactly how the controversial armament is being employed. White phosphorus shells are intended to make smoke screens or signals for advancing troops. When launched against soldiers and civilians, however, the munition can cause severe burn wounds that can be dangerous for medical personnel treating the injured. [Saudi Arabia appears to be using U. S.",
        "For God\u2019s sake, if your employee needs a drink, especially if she\u2019s diabetic, just let her have it already. That\u2019s what Dollar General learned after a federal jury sided with the U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in a case against the retail giant. The story goes like this. Back in September 2014, an diabetic cashier in Dollar General\u2019s Maryville, Tenn. store told her supervisor she needed to keep juice near the cash register in case of a hypoglycemic attack.",
        "The audio recording, as described in a Maryland courtroom Thursday, was horrifying. \u201cHold her down,\u201d a young man said. The voice belonged to Cecil Burrows, 23, who was sentenced to 18 months in jail for his role in what prosecutors described as a gang rape of a nearly comatose woman in a townhouse in the Montgomery County community of Olney. Burrows not only recorded the rape, he called out instructions. \u201cCecil, he like a coach,\u201d one of the attackers could be heard saying. Authorities have said the victim was probably drunk or drugged during the assault.",
        "Photographer Emily Stein\u2018s young neighbors, children in a black family, were being chastised at school for having hairstyles that were \u201ctoo colorful. \u201d \u201c[It] struck me as upsetting and something I wanted to celebrate,\u201d she said via email. So she and an assistant ran all over the streets of London to create a photographic appreciation of black children\u2019s myriad hair sculptures. The pair would dash after children sporting a creative hairstyle, ask the parents\u2019 permission to take a photo, and then quickly tape up a sheet of brightly colored paper as a backdrop.",
        "CHARLOTTE \u2014 Police on Saturday released graphic video footage showing the final moments before police officers fatally shot Keith Lamont Scott. The release of dashboard and body camera footage follows days of pressure from community activists and protesters hoping to shed light on what occurred in the moments leading up to the shooting, which has been the subject of disagreement between Smith\u2019s family members and police since his death on Tuesday. Police had previously refused to release the footage, saying it would compromise their investigation.",
        "HIGH POINT, N. C. \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s week began in the wake of explosions in New Jersey and New York. It ended in the aftermath of shootings and riots. For a candidate whose strategy relies on painting a dystopian view of the nation \u2014 often based on inaccurate and questionable claims \u2014 the tragedies yielded a trove of political opportunities.",
        "Monday\u2019s debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is the most anticipated event of a presidential campaign filled with remarkable and revolting moments. But if the debate season, when it\u2019s all over, has changed the trajectory of the race, it will be a surprise. Amid all the sound and fury, changes now seem to come in inches. The first debate, at Hofstra University, should be great theater. Trump, an unguided missile, will be seeking to project a calmer demeanor and a command of the facts, enough at least to reassure voters who doubt his capacity to serve.",
        "In a speech filled with reminders of America\u2019s dark and past, and hopes for a brighter future, President Obama helped to inaugurate the National Museum of African American History and Culture today in Washington. The country\u2019s first black chief executive stood before a crowd of more than 7, 000 official guests \u2014 and thousands more gathered on the National Mall \u2014 and repeated the words of poet Langston Hughes: \u201cI, too, am America. \u201d \u201cAfrican American history is not somehow separate than the American story. It is not the underside of the American story.",
        "For more than eight years, Barack Obama has sought to explain the African American experience to the rest of the country. As he inaugurated the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Saturday, the president suggested the new institution might give both sides of the current racial divide a chance to see each other in a way that still eludes us. \u201cWe\u2019re not a burden on America, or a stain on America, or an object of pity, or charity for America. We\u2019re America,\u201d the president said.",
        "In 2013, when the founders of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture were seeking donors, people directed them to one man: Robert F. Smith. \u201cWe kept wondering, \u2018Who is this Robert Smith?\u2019 \u201d said Adrienne Brooks, director of development for the museum. Meeting Smith became a priority, said Lonnie G. Bunch III, the museum\u2019s founding director. \u201cWe wanted to meet him. And soon,\u201d Bunch said, laughing. Soon many more people will know Robert Smith by name as the museum celebrates its grand opening this weekend.",
        "I am in the building, but mostly I\u2019m in my head. Thinking of the past, considering the future. Mesmerized by the right now. This building, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, is monumental in scale. Grand and breathtaking with its elegant filigree panels of aluminum. The light bounces off the metal, pulling the eye upward, and the building glows. It tugs at emotions, too, because it\u2019s been so long in coming \u2014 a dream, a endeavor. But mostly, the building is dignified. And that is a source of tremendous pride.",
        "A manhunt is underway Saturday for a gunman police said opened fire at a mall in Washington state, killing four women and one man, authorities said. The shooting took place about 7 p. m. Friday in the makeup department of a Macy\u2019s store at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Wash. about 60 miles north of Seattle, authorities said in a news conference Saturday morning. \u201cThere are people waking up this morning and their world has changed forever,\u201d an emotional Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton said. \u201cThis was a senseless act.",
        "Belen Mella spent hours prepping for the local high school debate tournament in Miami Beach, researching the topics and practicing speeches under her breath on her morning commute to school. She knew that she was a young debater and that she needed to speak with more poise and confidence. She was prepared to receive constructive criticism. But after her first round of competition, she received a confusing bit of feedback: She was told that she did not seem \u201cpresidential. \u201d Looking back, Mella finds it frustrating.",
        "When I walked into the new National Museum of African American History and Culture for a preview last week, my excitement was tempered. I\u2019d heard about the feats of engineering: rooms built around a massive guard tower from Louisiana\u2019s Angola Prison, a Southern Railroad train car and a Tuskegee plane. I\u2019d heard about the big donations from Oprah Winfrey and Michael Jordan. I\u2019d followed the campaign for real estate and funding that were required to make this new institution a reality. But that was the story of the museum itself.",
        "Though our capital is a city of familiar rhythms \u2014 the quadrennial inauguration, the monthly jobs report, the annual distribution of unwanted White House correspondents\u2019 dinner swag \u2014 Washington is by no means static. The terms we use to describe our politics change as regularly as a president\u2019s approval ratings.",
        "Most Americans get their ideas about the Middle Ages from popular culture, like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d or from the inevitable rigmarole after a politician refers to \u201ca crusade. \u201d In other words, it\u2019s all dragons, dastardly politics and violence. Yet, the European Middle Ages \u2014 a period spanning more than 1, 000 years \u2014 was much richer (and weirder) than even some of the best fiction or political spin. Myth No. 1 Christianity and Islam were constantly in con\ufb02ict. In 638 A. D.",
        "Kathleen Parker is a Washington Post columnist. Her 2008 book, \u201cSave the Males,\u201d was inspired by Maureen Dowd\u2019s \u201cAre Men Necessary?\u201d Certain times seem made for certain people, and the now seems to belong to Maureen Dowd. With a resurgence of the Clintons, upon whose deceits and conceits Dowd gnawed her way to the 1999 Pulitzer Prize \u2014 and the added bounty of the fathomless Donald Trump \u2014 the New York Times columnist hasn\u2019t had to wonder for a while: Hmm, what shall I write about today?",
        "On a clear afternoon last Monday a line of humanitarian aid trucks eased to a stop in front of a cluster of warehouses packed with aid supplies 15 miles outside the Syrian city of Aleppo. Omar Barakat, director of the local Red Crescent branch, supervised the loading of the convoy, which was scheduled to drive into the battered city that evening. Hours later, Barakat would be dead, his body one of 20 strewn through the convoy\u2019s burning wreckage after airstrikes hit the idling trucks. The Sept.",
        "Jerika Bolen\u2019s prom night was one many girls would wish for \u2014 a brimming ballroom bathed in green and black embellishments with a queen to match, wearing a glimmering greenish gown, a tiara and a sash. But for Jerika, it would be her last. Jerika, from Appleton, Wis. had Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy, a condition that destroys the nerves that control muscle movement. She knew her fate \u2014 the disease most often robs its victims of life by adolescence."
