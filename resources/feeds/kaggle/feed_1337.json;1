        "Sen. Ted Cruz called Donald Trump a \u201dserial philander.\u201d He called him a \u201dpathological liar.\u201d He warned the real estate mogul to leave his wife \u201dthe hell alone.\u201d And then, on Friday, Cruz endorsed Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy. Er, what? Yes, the Texas senator announced Friday on Facebook that he had decided to support the man who once suggested his father was part of a plot to assassinate former president John F. Kennedy and insinuated that his wife was ugly. Why? Hillary Clinton, of course.",
        "To fight the Islamic State terrorist group, Donald Trump would \u201cbomb the out of\u201d their oil fields or \u201cbomb the hell out of ISIS. \u201d Or maybe neither of those things. The GOP presidential nominee has called for \u201cvery few troops on the ground,\u201d but also 20, 000 to 30, 000 troops. Or he might just let Russia handle the fighting. He proposed banning all foreign Muslims from entering the United States until we \u201cfigure out what is going on\u201d with terrorism. Or maybe just people from certain countries.",

        "KHANPUR, India \u2014 For decades, this riverside hamlet of Indians made liquor for a living by fermenting the fruit of the mahua tree, but since a strict prohibition was imposed in Bihar state in April, police have begun raiding homes, chasing away drinkers and arresting villagers. In response, the village vowed to give up its main source of income and poured 200 gallons of freshly made hooch into the river in a public declaration of defeat. \u201cNow where do we go, what do we do?",

        "When Keith Cartwright played football in high school, he never ran more than 200 yards at one time. He was a running back, so he didn\u2019t have to do more than a sprint. \u201cMy buddies know me as an runner,\u201d Cartwright said. Now 52 years old, Cartwright, who lives near Richmond, has become a runner in large part because of Meg\u2019s Miles, a group that came together after the passing of Meg Menzies.

        "A roller coaster of a campaign 18 months in the making arrives Monday at a huge moment for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: a debate, with much of the nation expected to tune in amid great uncertainty about what they\u2019ll see. Virtually tied in recent national polls, both Clinton and Trump enter the debate as the two most deeply unpopular presidential candidates in modern history. Both hope to discredit the other, and both hope to emerge from the debate having burnished the public\u2019s view that they are better qualified to be commander in chief.",
        "Democrats are now facing a tougher road to capturing the Senate majority as the presidential race tightens and Donald Trump is not proving to be the dramatic drag on candidates that Republicans once feared. Trump\u2019s resilience and faltering Democratic campaigns in battleground states mean the fight for the Senate has settled into a brawl likely to result in a chamber that will be closely divided or potentially even tied.",

When asked about Trump\u2019s characterization of black life, Obama said, \u201dI think even an will tell you that whole slavery thing wasn\u2019t very good for black people. Jim Crow wasn\u2019t very good for black people.\u201d Donald Trump says black voters \u201dhave nothing to lose\u201d by choosing him instead of Hillary Clinton.",
        "The sun is just dawning over a parking lot wedged between a cornfield and a Bob Evans in southwestern Indiana. The farmers arrive early. This is like sleeping in for them.

Security Council meeting called to demand that Russia rein in its ally, Syrian President Bashar and halt the blistering attacks on Syria\u2019s second city. \u201cInstead of pursuing peace, Russia and Assad make war,\u201d said Samantha Power, the U.

        "I don t envy Lester Holt. No matter what he does in the first presidential debate, he ll be denounced. But this certainty should be liberating. If you know the brickbats will come one way or the other, you might as well do the right thing. But is there a right thing that doesn t coincide with someone s political agenda? That is precisely the wrong question, because any choice Holt makes will be interpreted as favoring one candidate over the other.

        "The conversation \u2014 or argument \u2014 we\u2019ve been having on immigration has been remarkably skewed. It\u2019s been all about the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, otherwise known as the \u201cundocumented. \u201d Actually, what counts far more are the estimated 31 million immigrants who are here legally and the roughly 1 million who gain legal entry every year. Of course, the question of undocumented immigrants is important.",
        "In his final appearance before the U. N. General Assembly a few days ago, President Obama didn\u2019t have much to say about the civil war between Syrian dictator Bashar and his enemies. \u201cThere\u2019s no ultimate military victory to be won,\u201d he said, and so the United States would \u201cpursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement. \u201d Then he moved on to other matters.",

        "ALMOST NO ONE is talking about it, but California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed a hugely consequential bill this month. The law, SB 32, drastically ramps up the state\u2019s landmark climate change law in the world\u2019s economy. The world is watching closely: If California\u2019s policy appears to be working, it will be copied in states and countries across the globe. Which makes it all the more important for state leaders to get it right.",
        "Things would change, city officials in Charlotte vowed three years ago, after a white police officer shot and killed a black man seeking help after he was injured in a car accident. There would be new training and community outreach designed to prevent encounters from escalating into police gunfire. But change has been slow to come to Charlotte and across the nation, since Jonathan Ferrell died in 2013. Last week, a black police officer shot and killed another black man, Keith Lamont Scott, triggering massive, sometimes violent protests.",
        "Jo Ann Bjornson spent her early childhood in the care of babysitters until it came time for her to board the bus to school for classes, an event that came with little fanfare. For her daughter Isabella, the days before kindergarten started this month included structured preschool, a bevy of summer camps and months of agonizing over whether the smart, sensitive was academically and socially ready to start school. Kindergarten, where children were once encouraged to play and adjust to the rhythms of the school day, has long been evolving.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s threat to seat Gennifer Flowers, who had an extramarital affair with Bill Clinton, in the front row at Monday night\u2019s presidential debate focuses new attention to Trump\u2019s own history of infidelity and could further weaken his support among female voters. Trump\u2019s suggestion, delivered Saturday via a Tweet, was widely seen as an effort to rattle Clinton ahead of Monday\u2019s debate and fired up some of his hardcore supporters. Trump\u2019s campaign reversed course Sunday, saying Flowers was not going to be invited to the debate.",
        "It\u2019s a common refrain that Donald Trump rallies are not exactly a mirror image of the diversity of the American population. His pitch to black voters has often been offered in fron of audiences that are nearly entirely white, in towns and cities that are similarly homogeneous. At a glance, Trump seems to have the clear support of white Americans. But, compared to past Republican candidates, that\u2019s not necessarily the case. His large audiences may be mostly white, but whites are much more split than they were four years ago.",
        "We interrupt this political feeding frenzy for a tiny moment of appreciation and optimism. On Monday at 9 p. m. the nation will gather together \u2014 about as much as we ever gather together \u2014 perhaps 100 million strong. And we\u2019ll do it for something that matters even more, if you can believe it, than the Super Bowl, which is the other time we come together in such numbers.

        "EAST RUTHERFORD, N. J. \u2014 Even at their best, the Washington Redskins were going to have a tough time halting their skid against the New York Giants on Sunday at MetLife Stadium, where they had won only once since 2008 and, more often than not, trudged home humiliated. But history reversed course in a wild one, with the Redskins pulling off a victory even though they squandered multiple touchdown opportunities and lost key starters along the way. With it, the Redskins improved to ( in the NFC East).",
        "Authorities said Sunday they did not yet know why a man in Burlington, Wash. shot five people dead with a rifle at a Macy\u2019s makeup counter over the weekend. The suspect, Arcan Cetin, was described by high school friends and neighbors as a troubled person who made vulgar comments toward women.

He learned English, married and raised his own children here, and built a flourishing bakery and kebab house that employs 20 people and is packed every evening.",

The American Medical Association issued a warning in June that LED streetlights \u2014 such as those in Seattle, Los Angeles, New York, Houston and elsewhere \u2014 emit unseen blue light that can disturb sleep rhythms and possibly increase the risk of serious health conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. The AMA also cautioned that those lights can impair nighttime driving vision."
