        "Donald Trump\u2019s charitable foundation has received approximately $2. 3 million from companies that owed money to Trump or one of his businesses but were instructed to pay Trump\u2019s foundation instead, according to people familiar with the transactions. In cases where he diverted his own income to his foundation, tax experts said, Trump would still likely be required to pay taxes on the income. Trump has refused to release his personal tax returns. His campaign said he paid income tax on one of the donations, but did not respond to questions about the others.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will meet Monday at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N. Y. for their first presidential debate \u2014 the culmination of months of fierce political battle. They will bring their own aims and political baggage, their own styles and quirks. The clash between Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Trump, the Republican nominee, represents the most dramatic showdown yet in an already raucous election season, as well as an opportunity for these universally known personalities to reintroduce themselves to voters that have deep reservations or remain undecided.",
        "Donald Trump would pull the United States out of the World Trade Organization if necessary to help American companies sell more abroad. He thinks that he can close the United States\u2019 $500 billion trade deficit within two years by renegotiating trade deals. And he sees this new approach to trade as the key complement to a bevy of traditional Republican policies \u2014 tax cuts, energy drilling and deregulation \u2014 that will supercharge the economy, according to a new campaign analysis that lays out the Republican candidate\u2019s economic strategy in the most detail yet.",
        "In April of 1937, the war planes of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy chose a market day to bomb a Basque town, one of the first times a civilian population was deliberately targeted. Pablo Picasso, a native of Spain, quickly reacted by depicting the horror in his famous mural named for the town, \u201cGuernica. \u201d It was finished by June. If he were alive today, he might want to paint one called \u201cAleppo. \u201d It should be mounted outside the White House. Aleppo is not some quaint market town.",
        "Ray Takeyh is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the of \u201cThe Pragmatic Superpower: Winning the Cold War in the Middle East. \u201d It is often suggested that the most consequential barrier to Iranian pragmatism is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Once the elderly Khamenei passes from the scene, the argument goes, his successors will embrace prevailing international norms. The sunsetting restrictions of the nuclear deal need not be of concern, for a revamped Islamist regime will find global integration too tempting to discard for the sake of nuclear arms.",
        "This was supposed to be the year that members of Congress finally started acting like . Instead, while most of the United States has been distracted by the circus of the presidential campaign, Congress has regressed further into childishness, proving itself lazier, more incompetent and more obstructionist then even its fiercest critics could have imagined. Not so long ago, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) promised that, after years of dysfunction and infighting, 2016 would represent a new beginning.",
        "In advance of Monday\u2019s presidential debate, we are in the grip of a maddening epistemological argument over the nature of facts and truth in a world where they seem to have lost a good portion of their meaning. Does it even matter who\u2019s lying and who isn\u2019t anymore? How did this happen? Is it Donald Trump\u2019s fault, or is it a failure of the media? Is there anything we can do about it? We\u2019ll get to the answers to those questions in a moment, but first let\u2019s look at the bizarre place we\u2019re at right now.",
        "Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and the leader of the country\u2019s main guerrilla group signed a historic peace accord Monday, in a ceremony meant to promote their agreement to end the country\u2019s armed conflict. Held in the colonial city of Cartagena, the event marked the first time that Santos and Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, publicly appeared together on Colombian soil. U. S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, U. N.",
        "Late last year, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack strode into the Oval Office to tell President Obama that he wanted to resign. \u201cMr. President,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s time to go. \u201d Vilsack had survived nearly eight years in Washington as Obama\u2019s model Cabinet secretary \u2014 a disciplined and efficient technocrat who understood the inner workings of his department, worked well with lawmakers and did not cause trouble for the White House. Lately, though, that approach did not seem to be enough to fix the problems he was seeing in the country.",
        "CHARLOTTE, N. C. \u2014 Crucial evidence in the police shooting death of Keith Scott is not available because one of the officers failed to activate his body camera as soon as he responded to the encounter, in violation of department policy. The department released two videos late Saturday after four days of sometimes violent protests here over the death of Scott, who police said had a gun. Neither video is conclusive on that question.",
        "The fourth time around, it doesn\u2019t get any easier to bury a son lost to gun violence. Phyllis Gray is 53 and tired. Tired of the calls, tired of the funerals, tired of with the faces of four dead sons. Tired of no justice. She tried to lift her spirits a bit over the weekend with a new haircut, but, of course, it didn\u2019t help.",
        "Lawmakers were skeptical last week when Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said that the company made only $100 in profit for a of EpiPens. During a House hearing, Bresch repeatedly referred to a poster board showing how little of the $608 list price trickled back to the company. The incredulity was warranted: The profits Bresch told Congress about were calculated after factoring in the 37. 5 percent U. S. tax rate, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
        "Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat for a Sunday interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos in which they discussed the Republican nominee\u2019s alleged prowess as a debater, his casual relationship with facts and a bunch of other stuff too. Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me! To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript.

        "NEW YORK \u2014 On the morning of the first presidential debate, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201dMorning Joe\u201d and was pushed again and again to explain why her candidate said that debate moderator Lester Holt is a Democrat when he is actually a registered Republican. Kellyanne Conway declared that Holt was \u201da great selection for a moderator\u201d and that this was a \u201dterrible and irrelevant example\u201d of something Trump had said, trying to pivot the conversation to attacking his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.",
        "LHASA, China \u2014 In the contest for Tibetan hearts and minds, a Buddhist monk is emerging into the spotlight. He is the Panchen Lama, and he is being groomed by the Communist Party to fill an important political and religious role in Tibet. Obedient to the party and loyal to the Chinese state, the \u201cChinese Panchen\u201d is being pushed forward as an alternative to the Dalai Lama, a man widely loved by Tibetans as their supreme religious leader, but reviled by the Chinese Communist Party as a \u201cwolf in monk\u2019s clothing\u201d trying to split Tibet from the motherland.",
        "Murders in the United States jumped 11 percent last year, according to federal data released Monday, but nonviolent crimes declined, an unusual divergence that\u2019s puzzling criminal justice experts. While an increase in homicide is usually associated with more minor crimes as well, that was not the case in 2015. The number of murders nationally increased by the largest percentage in decades, but violent crimes overall increased just 4 percent and property crimes declined 3 percent. Despite the increase, American streets remain safe relative to recent years.",
        "In \u201cThe five things no one will tell you about why colleges don\u2019t hire more faculty of color,\u201d a piece first published in the Hechinger Report, Marybeth Gasman took on a common question: Why aren\u2019t college faculties more racially diverse? It\u2019s a question gaining increased urgency from student protesters demanding change on campuses nationally.",
        "Back in the \u201990s, Allegra Lucier had an exhausting bartending gig at a rock bar in the East Village. Night after night, she got hit on. \u201cSo this one gentleman passed me a note one evening, and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not doing this,\u2019 and I passed the note back. He passed it again, I passed it back, he passed it again, and I was like, \u2018If you want me to get you a drink, I\u2019ll get you a drink \u2014 other than that . . . leave me alone.\u2019 He passed the note again.",
        "Over the weekend, the Financial Times published my review of Nicholas Eberstadt\u2019s important new book Men Without Work. The core message is captured in the graph below: Job destruction caused by technology is not a futuristic concern. It is something we have been living with for two generations. A simple linear trend suggests that by about a quarter of men between 25 and 54 will not be working at any moment. I think this likely a substantial underestimate unless something is done for a number of reasons.",
        "Enfermera is pictured at the Famproa dogs shelter. Enfermera (Nurse) was given that name because she was rescued by a nurse outside of a hospital. (Carlos Garcia ) Venezuela is in a state of crisis. Prices for everyday necessities have skyrocketed. And that goes for the things that people need to feed their animals. Dog food can fetch up to $50 for a bag. According to Reuters, the average minimum wage that Venezuelans are pulling in is $23 a month.",
        "Hillary Clinton moved to capitalize Tuesday on a debate performance that exposed vulnerabilities for Donald Trump, excoriating his values and character in an effort to expand her coalition of women, minorities and young voters. Trump, meanwhile, scrambled to move his campaign forward. While the Republican nominee insisted that he was not unnerved, he and his advisers grasped at excuses to explain why he did not perform better at the first presidential debate Monday night.",
        "RALEIGH, N. C.  \u201d Hillary Clinton took a moment Tuesday, and then several more, to revel in her performance from the night before.  Did anybody see that debate last night",
        "Republicans learned again during the first presidential debate that no matter the setting, no matter the stakes, no matter the expectations, Donald Trump will insist on being Donald Trump. He will rise or fall politically as himself \u2014 brash, unpredictable, volatile and true to his own instincts. Monday\u2019s debate might not move mountains politically. Most Americans are already set in stone about their choice on Nov. 8. But Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t need an earthshaking event on Monday.",
        "CARY, N. C. \u2014 Donald Trump so captured Ron Townley\u2019s attention as \u201can outsider ready to tear down the system,\u201d just the one who might break the Washington logjam, the doer to build new airports and highways, that he was considering voting for him. But Trump\u2019s response Monday night when Hillary Clinton accused him of not paying a cent of federal tax left Townley appalled. \u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d Trump said, unapologetic and smiling, during the presidential debate, held in Hempstead, N. Y.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s decision to attack a former Miss Universe for gaining too much weight thrust the actress into the middle of the presidential campaign on Tuesday \u2014 an outcome that was welcomed and encouraged by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Alicia Machado alleges that Trump called her names such as \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d because she gained weight after winning the Miss Universe crown in 1996, when Trump owned the pageant. Clinton brought up Machado\u2019s case during Monday\u2019s first presidential debate, prompting a furious response from Trump that night and into Tuesday next morning.",
        "My heart went out to Donald Trump Monday night when it appeared that he was under the weather. What could be worse than to be sick, sniffling through his first presidential debate just days after he was challenging Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and, during the debate, taunting her lack of stamina? Trump\u2019s own stamina was not, shall we say, in abundance Monday. and gulping water, he looked as though he might fall asleep were it not for the lectern\u2019s support. Could his malady perhaps explain his utter incoherence?",
        "It seemed like a no brainer: Tie Republican Candidate X to Donald Trump and watch Candidate X go down in his or her race for the Senate, the House or dog catcher. This should be true in competitive races, because of the GOP presidential nominee\u2019s unpopularity. But it\u2019s not working out that way. There\u2019s new evidence that attempts to tie other Republicans to Trump isn\u2019t playing well \u2014 and it might even be hurting Democrats.",
        "BUENOS AIRES Watching Monday night\u2019s presidential debate from a country that has been bankrupted by populist economic ideas was instructive: Argentina\u2019s experience shows that good countries can make very bad political decisions that have lasting costs. Visiting here with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew was also a reminder of how intently the rest of the world is following this year\u2019s U. S. election campaign. American power remains a basic ordering principle of global life, however much Uncle Sam is maligned. So when Donald Trump proclaims, as he did Aug.",

        "\u201cThis country needs better leadership,\u201d said Evan McMullin. So many armchair politicians say those words and fail to follow through. Not McMullin. The independent candidate for president threw his hat in the ring more than a month ago and has been taken seriously ever since. Even conservative columnist Erick Erickson declared last week, \u201cMcMullin\u2019s candidacy is not the lesser of an evil, but an alternative against evil. \u201d That\u2019s a stamp of approval that should gain more currency for other conservatives after Donald Trump\u2019s disaster of a debate against Hillary Clinton on Monday."
