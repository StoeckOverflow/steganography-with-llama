Mr. LePage, who entered office in 2011 refusing to attend Martin Luther King Jr. Day events or meet with representatives of the NAACP, has a long history of racial animus, and this year he has outdone himself.",

Six days had passed since the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott \u2014 a period marked by anger and unrest in North Carolina\u2019s largest city. Zianna had come to discuss race relations. More specifically, the young girl wanted to talk to city leaders and police about being black. \u201cI\u2019ve come here today to talk about how I feel, and I feel like that we are treated differently than other people,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like how we\u2019re treated.",

        "Sean Hannity is Donald Trump\u2019s last hope. have repeatedly debunked the notion that Trump publicly opposed the Iraq War, so the Republican presidential nominee is clinging to the uncheckable claim that before the 2003 invasion he used to call up Hannity after the Fox News host\u2019s show to say he was against the war. \u201dI had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox,\u201d Trump said during Monday\u2019s debate.",
        "Even as Hillary Clinton was pronounced the winner of the first presidential debate, pundits rated its first 15 minutes as a win for Donald Trump. The day after, the initial exchanges about trade and taxes largely vanished from the discussion, as Clinton\u2019s campaign made former Miss Universe Alicia Machado available for interviews on how Trump had shamed her for gaining weight. But for Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) Clinton\u2019s opening answers were the start of a promising, populist case against Trump, the kind he had tried to make throughout the Democratic primaries.",
        "The first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is in the books. I tweeted, took notes and picked some winners and losers. They\u2019re below. Winners * Hillary Clinton: Clinton wasn\u2019t perfect in this debate. At times she came across as overly rehearsed and robotic. I thought her answer on race relations was way too much head and not enough heart. But, Clinton was head and shoulders better than Trump. She was, unsurprisingly, very well prepared using a slew of facts and figures to not only make her positive case but also to slam Trump.",
        "Why are black preschoolers in America more than three times as likely to be suspended than their white classmates? Perhaps because teachers are more likely to expect young black children \u2014 especially young black boys \u2014 to misbehave, according to a new Yale study. The study, conducted by researchers at the Yale University Child Study Center, asked more than 130 preschool teachers to watch video clips of children in classrooms.

This conclusion was part of a study by the United Nations\u2019 Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, a body that reports to the international organization\u2019s High Commissioner on Human Rights.

        "BEIRUT \u2014 The bombings at night are the worst. There is no electricity in the portion of eastern Aleppo, and the warplanes flying overhead target any light piercing the blackness beneath. So families huddle together in the dark, gathered in one room so that they don\u2019t die alone, listening to the roar of the jets and waiting for the bombs to fall. After they do, rescue workers venture out, navigating the rubble and craters left by earlier bombings, to dig out victims without headlights or lamps.",

        "DAVAO, Philippines \u2014 People here love to tell stories about the man they call \u201cour mayor. \u201d One time, when a tourist ignored rules, our mayor stormed a restaurant with a revolver and forced him to eat the cigarette butt.

The mayor they speak of is Rodrigo Duterte, who ran this coastal city on the island of Mindanao, in the southern Philippines, for more than two decades before he was elected president this spring.",
        "Congress on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to override President Obama\u2019s veto of legislation that would allow victims\u2019 families to sue the Saudi Arabian government over its alleged support for the terrorists who carried out the attacks. It is the first override of Obama\u2019s presidency. The votes in the House and Senate amounted to a sweeping, bipartisan rejection of pleas from the White House to back the president, with administration officials arguing the legislation poses a national security threat by exposing U. S. officials to similar lawsuits abroad.",
        "Looking on the bright side, perhaps this election can teach conservatives to look on the dark side. They need a talent for pessimism, recognizing the signs that whatever remains of American exceptionalism does not immunize this nation from decay, to which all regimes are susceptible. The world\u2019s oldest political party is an exhausted volcano, the intellectual staleness of its recycled candidate unchallenged because a generation of younger Democratic leaders barely exists. The Republican Party\u2019s candidate evidently disdains his credulous supporters who continue to swallow his mendacities.",

        "Donald Trump\u2019s in Monday\u2019s debate surely gave queasy stomachs to Republicans who have bowed before his candidacy despite their better judgments. Trump threatens to give conservative appeasers a very bad name. Let it be said that at least some in the party will be able to stand proudly after this election is over. We\u2019re witnessing real courage among those members of the party of Lincoln willing to say openly how genuinely dangerous a Trump presidency would be.",
        "Philip Gordon is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. From 2013 to 2015 he was special assistant to President Obama and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf. One of Vice President Biden\u2019s favorite sayings on foreign policy is to never tell another man or woman what\u2019s in his or her interest. That is a good general rule; I heard him repeat the saying many times while I was working on Middle East policy in the White House.",
        "FORMER VIRGINIA senator John W. Warner, a Republican widely revered for his national security expertise during a of public service, had never supported a Democrat for president before he endorsed Hillary Clinton on Wednesday. It wasn\u2019t the first time Mr. Warner, who retired in 2009, has bucked his party; famously he backed a Democrat to succeed him in the Senate. So it was unsurprising that some Republicans in Donald Trump\u2019s camp sniffed at Mr. Warner\u2019s declaration as fresh evidence of his party disloyalty. The real question, though, is how anyone immersed in national security could possibly endorse Mr.",

Comey on Wednesday rejected the idea that the bureau would reopen its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state \u2014 laying to rest a hope of Republican legislators who have questioned the government\u2019s handling of the case. At a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, Republican congressmen again peppered Comey with questions about how he came to the conclusion that Clinton should not be charged in connection with her server use. As he has at other hearings, Comey did not bend from his earlier decision.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 As tributes poured in from abroad, Israel prepared to say goodbye to Shimon Peres, one of the founders of the Jewish state, who died Wednesday of complications from a massive stroke.

        "Donald Trump singled out people who were not Christian conservatives at a campaign rally in Iowa on Wednesday afternoon, jokingly asking the audience, \u201cshould we keep them in the room?\u201d The comment, which Trump made in jest, came as Trump was applauding a Christian conservative group for supporting him. \u201cWe have our Christian Conservatives for Trump today, and they\u2019re in the room.

        "If you\u2019ve been paying attention to the presidential race over the past two months or so, you\u2019ll notice that Rudy Giuliani has repeatedly been willing to say things about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that no one else would not even Donald Trump.
