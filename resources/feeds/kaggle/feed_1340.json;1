        "Donato Di Camillo\u2018s cellmate in prison used to poke fun at him for his fascination with photography. \u201cWhat \u2014 do you think you\u2019re going to become a big photographer and go take pictures in Africa?\u201d he joked. But since being released from prison, Di Camillo\u2019s searing images have stunned people around the world. Di Camillo, 47, was first arrested at 11 or 12 for stealing a car stereo. He received little more than a slap on the wrist. But in the eyes of some in his Brooklyn neighborhood, he \u201chad graduated.",

        "Hillary Clinton has wrestled with allegations surrounding her husband s infidelities for much of their   marriage, including a sexual harassment lawsuit, a grand jury investigation and an impeachment vote centered on his untruthfulness about a relationship with a White House intern. Now, her Republican opponent Donald Trump and his surrogates have signaled that he may bring up the subject in the next presidential debate, treacherous territory, given his own infidelities and treatment of women.",
        "Donald Trump has a serious weight problem: He can\u2019t seem to stop criticizing the girth of others. For decades, Trump has commented on other people\u2019s bodies, particularly women who he believes had gained too much weight or were, in his word, \u201cfat. \u201d The recurring habit flared again this week when the Republican presidential nominee attacked the size of a Miss Universe winner, claiming she had gained \u201ca massive amount of weight\u201d while she wore the pageant\u2019s crown and that \u201cit was a real problem.",

Initially, my focus was on commercializing the Internet, expanding access and putting appropriate rules of the road in place. In the past decade, my focus shifted to encouraging policies that foster innovation, generate jobs, help and create opportunity.",
        "NEW DELHI \u2014 Sporadic shelling broke out along India and Pakistan\u2019s disputed border in Kashmir on Thursday after India said it conducted an strike inside the section controlled by Pakistan \u2014 marking a significant rise in tension between the two rivals. India\u2019s military said its soldiers had crept over the highly militarized border in darkness and struck at about half a dozen staging areas early Thursday where it said teams of militants were gathering, preparing to launch attacks both in the disputed Kashmir region and in unspecified cities across India.",
        "Former Pvt. Thomas Jacob Weaver was in bed late one night, near the end of his three months at Marine Corps boot camp, when several drill instructors burst into his platoon\u2019s room. Many of them smelled like they had been drinking whiskey, he said, and they ordered the recruits to crawl over cement floors covered in laundry detergent. Soon after, the instructors left the room and then abruptly returned. One of them demanded to know where he could find \u201cthe terrorist. \u201d Weaver knew immediately who he was talking about: a fellow Marine recruit who was Muslim.",
        "The Supreme Court will decide whether a federal law that bars the registration of disparaging trademarks violates free speech, a case with direct implications for the Washington Redskins in their fight to defend their famous team name. The justices on Thursday announced that they will consider whether part of the 1946 Lanham Trademark Act that prohibits registration of a trademark that \u201cmay disparage\u201d persons violates the First Amendment, as an appeals court has ruled. The court did not take the Redskins case, but instead chose another that is further along in the legal process.",
        "Donald Trump isn\u2019t afraid of being labeled as the guy who avoids paying taxes. At all. Trump didn\u2019t say Wednesday night whether he has paid income taxes over the past several decades, but he did say that someone who avoids paying them is what the country needs. During an appearance on Fox News with Bill O\u2019Reilly, Trump said that he didn\u2019t admit to paying no taxes during Monday night\u2019s debate. But he made the argument of a man who hasn\u2019t, saying it\u2019s the kind of leadership that the country needs. \u201dI never said I didn\u2019t pay taxes,\u201d Trump maintained.",
        "Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee for president, had been raring for Wednesday night\u2019s \u201dtown hall\u201d on MSNBC. He had been cut from the first televised debate after missing the polling threshold, and he had not been invited when the network hosted a \u201d forum\u201d with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. \u201dThis was their consolation prize,\u201d Johnson told The Washington Post this week when asked about the MSNBC special. \u201dIt was put to us that, look, you weren\u2019t in this initial program. Here\u2019s what we\u2019d like to offer in lieu of being with the two candidates.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is planning to attend the funeral on Friday of former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres in Jerusalem, despite stiff opposition from some Palestinians who view Peres not as a man of peace but as an enemy occupier. The Palestinian leader sent a formal request to attend the Friday service to Israeli Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, the military chief of the occupied West Bank. After a nod of approval by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Abbas was given permission.",
        "One of the mysteries of the oil market is the question of how much crude oil China has squirreled away in commercial and strategic stockpiles. Now a firm called Orbital Insight claims to have an answer. It says Chinese inventories in May stood at 600 million barrels, substantially more than commonly thought and nearly as much as the U. S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.",
        "Countries around the world are trying to get their greenhouse gas emissions under control \u2014 to see them inch down, percentage point by percentage point, from where they stood earlier in the century. If everybody gets on board, and shaves off enough of those percentage points, we just might be able to get on a trajectory to keep the world from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius above the temperature where it stood prior to industrialization.",
        "White House staffers, if you want to avoid a headache next year, take our advice and don\u2019t imitate Bill Clinton\u2019s team on your way out. We\u2019re referring to transition pranks, a tradition embraced most energetically by Clinton\u2019s staff when handing the reins to George W. Bush in 2001. (You\u2019ve probably heard about the missing W keys on White House keyboards.) There\u2019s a reason President Obama\u2019s senior aides are already setting expectations for a changeover in January 2017, no matter whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton takes over.",
        "\u201cWhen the Panama Canal expansion is complete, one of man and the world\u2019s greatest marvels will forever change the landscape, the economy, and the people of Panama,\u201d says photographer Andrew Kaufman in his artist statement for his project,\u201dThe Isthmus,\u201d a photo book on Panama and the Panama Canal expansion. The Panama Canal expansion project added a new lane, which allowed a larger number of ships and increased the width and depth of the lanes and locks, which allowed larger ships to pass. This doubled the capacity of the canal.",

One Georgia mom was pulling clothes from the dryer, with her son nearby, when she heard the boom and saw the damage. Another woman thought something had crashed through her roof. In one instance, metal shards flung into a hallway and ripped holes in the wall. Laundry rooms have flooded. A whole house shook.",
        "In June, a Quebec man named Farid Benzenati arrived at his house in Montreal\u2019s east end to see a dog outside, wrestling with a large object. The dog was new to the neighborhood, and Benzenati at first dismissed the tussle in the neighbor\u2019s backyard as playful. But then he saw human hair. \u201cIt was hard to see, but I knew it was a woman\u2019s body,\u201d Benzenati told CBC. \u201cI saw blood, and the dog was still attacking her. \u201d Police found Benzenati\u2019s neighbor, Christiane Vadnais, mauled to death. Responders pronounced Vadnais dead at the scene.",
        "In 1962, daytime television viewers were treated to a shocking story \u2014 a pivotal, historic moment for the medium. At the time, as Deadline noted, Agnes Nixon, the chief writer for \u201cGuiding Light,\u201d wanted to write a plot line in which its character Bert Bauer is diagnosed with uterine cancer after waiting too long to undergo a Pap smear. But she wasn\u2019t allowed to use the words \u201ccancer,\u201d \u201cuterus\u201d or \u201cPap test. \u201d Somehow, she pulled it off what is considered the first health story line in a daytime drama.",
        "In what it called an \u201cendorsement of conscience,\u201d the Detroit News has endorsed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson for president. It was the first time in its history that the newspaper has not endorsed a Republican. It said that while former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and temperament for the presidency, it did not agree with her on the issues and was troubled by her \u201c struggles with honesty and ethics\u201d and her \u201c approach to politics.",
        "Customs officials are employed to ensure travelers don\u2019t pop from country to country with dangerous items such as firearms, bombs or even illegal animals. So officials in Graz, the capital of the Austrian province of Styria, weren\u2019t exactly sure what to do when they inspected a bag and found a piece of human intestine residing there as if it were a pair of socks or a toothbrush. They found the intestine Sept. 8 while conducting a routine check of checked baggage entering Austria at Graz Airport.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 In the year since Russia began conducting airstrikes in support of the Syrian government, the intervention has worked to secure two of the most important Russian objectives. No longer is President Bashar \u2019s hold on power in Damascus seriously challenged by the rebellion against his rule. Russia\u2019s role as a regional and global power, a vital player in any effort to resolve the Syrian war, has also been assured. A third key goal remains elusive.",
        "Donald Trump disparaged former Miss Universe Alicia Machado\u2019s character during an early morning tweet storm Friday and accused her of having a \u201dsex tape. \u201d His attack on Machado, which appeared to be based on rumors circulating on the Internet, came amid an ongoing controversy over his comments about her weight gain in the months after she won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996. Trump\u2019s public treatment of Machado at the time has been at the center of intense scrutiny since his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, brought up Machado during Monday\u2019s presidential debate.",
        "While you were probably still sleeping, the 2016 Republican presidential nominee encouraged all of us to check out a \u201dsex tape\u201d and offered a baseless conspiracy theory about his opponent helping the woman from the alleged sex tape get citizenship so she could take him down. And in doing so, Donald Trump did everything Hillary Clinton could have hoped he would, drawing out a story about Alicia Machado, making things up and \u2014 above all \u2014 reinforcing all those very real questions about whether he has the temperament to be president.",
        "Even among the colorful pantheon of Texas lawmen, Hudspeth County Sheriff Arvin West has seized his share of the limelight. In his career patrolling the West Texas outback, he has busted crooner Willie Nelson for pot, accused the Mexican army of invading U. S. territory and repeatedly ripped the federal government on television over border security. Less well known are the country sheriff\u2019s strange connections to a rogue Navy intelligence office at the Pentagon that has been under criminal investigation for the past three years. The former director of the intelligence unit, David W.",
        "IF YOU know that Donald Trump is ignorant, unprepared and bigoted, but are thinking of voting for him anyway because you doubt he could do much harm \u2014 this editorial is for you. Your support of the Republican presidential nominee may be motivated by dislike of the Democratic alternative, disgust with the Washington establishment or a desire to send a message in favor of change. You may not approve of everything Mr. Trump has had to say about nuclear weapons, torture or mass deportations, but you doubt he could implement anything too radical.",
        "How about we hold off on dancing in the end zone in celebration of the new National Museum of African American History and Culture? And let\u2019s quit wasting time in pursuit of black celebrityhood. What about the danger staring us in the face? The prospect of a Donald Trump White House presents African Americans with the most consequential presidential election since the 1876 race between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden. That contest ultimately derailed efforts to extend the full rights and privileges of citizenship to freed African Americans.",
        "Sarai Walker is the author of the novel \u201cDietland. \u201d Like many fat women, I\u2019ve been called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d more than once in my life. As an advocate for fat acceptance, I suppose I should be happy that Donald Trump\u2019s fat shaming has become the hottest topic to come out of the first presidential debate. But it doesn\u2019t feel like a victory. What\u2019s largely been lost in all the attention to this story is that Alicia Machado isn\u2019t fat.",
        "Perhaps the best way to understand Donald Trump is as a case of arrested development. In terms of personality and worldview, Trump is stuck in middle school. Early middle school. And that\u2019s being charitable. Part of growing up is developing . Trump never has. Listen to him in the presidential debate, interjecting compulsively, and flash back to seventh grade and the boy in the back of the class who kept interrupting the teacher with wisecracks. It was amusing the first time or two. Then it became annoying.",
        "It was a case of the dog that didn\u2019t bark. For 90 minutes on Monday, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed in their first presidential debate on a full range of issues. But meriting not a single mention? Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act ripped apart the nation and dominated political argument for several years. But now, six years after enactment, Obamacare isn\u2019t on the radar screen during this election. And for good reason: The predicted apocalypse has not occurred. Remember that talk of Obamacare forcing employers to cut back on workers\u2019 hours and even \u201cphase out work\u201d? Didn\u2019t happen.",
        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. I admire Hillary Clinton. This is new for me. I have come to admire her only over the past year. Before Monday\u2019s debate, she had already sealed the deal. But everything I have come to see was on display that evening: intelligence, fortitude, discipline, strength and grace. Let me share my journey. For almost twenty years, Hillary Rodham Clinton put her political aspirations on hold when she moved to Arkansas to marry Bill Clinton, who would become the country\u2019s 42nd president."
