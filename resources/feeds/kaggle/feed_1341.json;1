        "The death penalty in America is continuing its steady decline. The United States is on pace to carry out fewer executions this year than it has in a and the number of states putting inmates to death and handing down fatal sentences have both plummeted. Yet through it all, one group has maintained its support for the death penalty: the American people. Polls have shown that while approval of capital punishment has declined since peaking two decades ago, a solid majority of people have still said they are in favor of the death penalty. Until now, at least.",
        "EL CAJON, Calif. \u2014 In a turnabout, police here Friday decided to release two videos, taken by a employee and a customer, showing the minutes leading to the fatal shooting by police of an unarmed black man. Police on Tuesday night had released a still photo taken from a video showing the police killing hours earlier of Alfred Olango, 38, an immigrant from Uganda. But backed by the district attorney, the police chief had refused until Friday to release the full video.",
        "Saturday Night The promotional video for the upcoming of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d hit the Internet this week like a \u201cStar Wars\u201d trailer, with dramatic lights and pounding music. Kate McKinnon revealed her debate face as Hillary Clinton \u2014 and Alec Baldwin sat for a fitting of a Donald Trump hairpiece like Darth Vader being fitted for his helmet. SNL, now in its 42nd season, has frequently shaped how voters see their presidential candidates.",
        "The \u201dDaily Show\u201d excoriated Donald Trump this week for complaining about his microphone after Monday\u2019s debate: \u201dDonald Trump sounds like my cousin who never accepts that I kicked his ass in \u201d Trevor Noah said. \u201dThat\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. \u2018The only reason you beat me, Trevor, is because the controller doesn\u2019t work!\u2019 \u201d CNN\u2019s \u201dReality Check\u201d column scoffed at the claim: \u201dThere was the bad microphone, which no one, except for him, seemed to notice.\u201d The aptly named (in this case) Mic.",
        "Donald Trump and his allies are dredging up the past marital infidelities of Hillary Clinton\u2019s husband \u2014 a move of questionable benefit that is bewildering even some of his staunchest supporters. The Republican nominee and his surrogates, under pressure to boost his standing with female voters and respond to Hillary Clinton\u2019s accusations that he is a misogynist, are turning to an attack that has been tried repeatedly by the Clintons\u2019 foes.",
        "Alabama\u2019s top judge was suspended from the bench without pay for the remainder of his term, the state\u2019s Court of the Judiciary said Friday. This is the second time Roy S. Moore, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, has been effectively pulled from office, following his ouster in 2003 over his refusal to obey judicial rulings ordering him to remove a Ten Commandments statue from the Alabama Judicial Building.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 On a cloudless blue morning, an honor guard brought the coffin of Shimon Peres to the Mount Herzl national cemetery Friday as 100 world leaders and dignitaries from 70 countries bid farewell to the former Israeli leader and Nobel laureate whose dream of a lasting peace with the Palestinians remains elusive. President Obama, who was the last to give a eulogy, said that the contribution made by Peres to Israel was \u201cso fundamental, so pervasive, it can sometimes be overlooked.",
        "Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday compared his campaign to kill criminals to the Holocaust, saying he would like to \u201dslaughter\u201d millions of addicts just like Adolf Hitler \u201dmassacred\u201d millions of Jewish people. \u201dHitler massacred three million Jews. Now, there are 3 million drug addicts. . .. I\u2019d be happy to slaughter them,\u201d he told reporters early Friday, according to GMA News. \u201dYou know my victims, I would like to be, all criminals, to finish the problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition,\u201d he said.",

The teenager says he had forgotten to grab the drink the first time through the line at the Graham Park Middle School cafeteria, so he headed back.

But a school resource officer said he spotted the teen cutting in line and accused him of stealing the milk.",
        "The soldiers of the last major guerrilla army in the Western Hemisphere have been mostly ghosts until now. A few appeared in grainy \u201cWanted\u201d posters and archival photographs, but most of the members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were anonymous phantoms, hiding somewhere deep in the jungle. Now they are coming out of the forest to prepare for peace, and Colombians are getting a long look at the faces of the enemy. Who, it turns out, look just like they do.",
        "Donald Trump has one week to prepare for his next debate with Hillary Clinton. It is a critical event for him. Yet everything he\u2019s done before and after the first debate sends a loud, clear message: He seems to think debate prep is for chumps. A candidate charged with lacking discipline just spent the week providing evidence for the prosecution. His Friday morning tweet storm \u2014 beginning at 3:20 a. m. with a rant about unnamed sources and resuming just after 5 a. m.",
        "In January, Marjorie Dannenfelser and nine other antiabortion activists urged Iowa voters to support anyone but Donald Trump. Now she is fully backing the Republican nominee, chairing the coalition of a man the activists said \u201ccannot be trusted. \u201d The dramatic for Dannenfelser and other religious and social conservatives who were once leery of supporting a brash, New Yorker who supported abortion rights and called Holy Communion a \u201clittle cracker\u201d is due in large part to one man: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.",
        "NASHUA, N. H. \u2014 With just five weeks of campaigning left, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are scrambling to win over female voters in America\u2019s suburbs as white women have emerged as perhaps the presidential campaign\u2019s most pivotal swing voting group. The Democratic and Republican nominees and their surrogates are making direct appeals to female voters in campaign appearances in the suburbs of North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and other battleground states; in television ads on channels such as Bravo and shows such as \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d; and on Facebook, where people\u2019s feeds inundate them with campaign commentary.",
        "In a living room in western Pennsylvania, the Republican National Convention was on TV, and Melanie Austin was getting impatient. \u201cWho\u2019s that guy?\u201d she said, watching some billionaire talk about prosperity and tolerance. \u201cProsperity and tolerance? Forget that . \u201d She lit a cigarette. Her boyfriend, Kevin Lisovich, was next to her on the couch, drifting to sleep, a pillow over his head. On the ottoman was her cellphone, her notes on the speakers so far \u2014 \u201cLOCK HER UP! !\u201d she had written \u2014 and the pills she kept in a silver vial on her keychain.",
        "The Supreme Court\u2019s new term begins Monday with the focus not on the court\u2019s docket but on the court itself and a future that will be defined by the presidential election. For the first time in decades, there will be only eight justices, not nine, to begin the new term. Also absent are the kind of cases \u2014 involving immigration reform, affirmative action, abortion, marriage and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that in recent years have catapulted the Supreme Court to the fore of American civic life.",
        "He sounds friendly, genial in the way Ronald Reagan did, and quietly brilliant, in the way of your favorite teacher. His voice \u2014 a blend of his native New York and the unhurried Southern California of the region\u2019s languid past \u2014 carries no edge. Compared with other sportscasters, he comes off as a bit proper. But he is no stuffed shirt.",
        "Much of the baseball world is understandably excited about the prospect of the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series for the first time in more than a century. The Cubs were preseason favorites this year, and they haven\u2019t disappointed, amassing the best record in baseball. And in the karma department, it would be hard to argue that it isn\u2019t their turn. The last time the Cubs won it all was 1908, the year that Ford introduced the Model T. Americans love to root for the underdog, so the Cubs would seem a natural cause to rally around.",
        "Donald Trump handed Hillary Clinton a great political gift last week with his interjection at their presidential debate. When she suggested that he didn\u2019t pay his federal income taxes, Trump replied, \u201cThat makes me smart. \u201d With that declaration, Trump appeared to admit that, as many suspected, he used various legal loopholes to pay no federal income tax in certain years. (Clinton paid $3, 624, 455, or 32. 4 percent of her income, in federal taxes in 2015). Trump seemed to assume that Americans would admire his savvy. He\u2019s almost certainly wrong.",
        "Hillary Clinton is presenting her extensive government experience as a major rationale for her presidential candidacy. In last Monday\u2019s debate, she countered Donald Trump\u2019s questioning of her stamina with the riposte: \u201cWell, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.",
        "For the past 18 years, I\u2019ve walked regularly down Howard Street, on the far northern fringe of Chicago. It\u2019s a colorful marketplace of dollar stores, chicken shacks, West Indian restaurants, groceries and sneaker shops. It\u2019s also the turf of Loyalty Over Cash, a Gangster Disciples faction that has been embroiled in a feud with the Insane Cutthroat Gangsters, another Gangster Disciples group operating a mile south. A few years ago, a gunman fired a bullet through a convenience store window, killing a customer inside. The store reopened two days later, without even covering the hole.",
        "At Monday night\u2019s debate, Donald Trump was called out for stiffing the people who work for him. Trump has been accused of failing to pay hundreds of contractors. And so far, he hasn\u2019t seemed very sorry. When asked about failing to pay someone by Hillary Clinton this week, Trump replied, \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work. \u201d I take that attack personally. I\u2019m one of the many small business owners who\u2019ve been used by Trump, exploited and forced to suffer a loss because of his corporation\u2019s shady practices.",
        "The largest hospital in eastern Aleppo was bombed Saturday for the second time in a week, killing and wounding more than a dozen patients as they recovered from earlier attacks. Doctors at the facility, known as M10, said the assault involved cluster munitions, barrel bombs and incendiary weapons, prompting mass panic and appeals for help. \u201cThe hospital is being destroyed. SOS, everyone,\u201d said Mohammad Abu Rajab, the hospital\u2019s administrator and radiologist, in an audio message sent to journalists Saturday morning.",
        "A boy died Saturday after being shot last week while heading to the playground at his South Carolina elementary school by a teenager, who is believed to have killed his own father. Jacob Hall had been in critical condition on life support since Wednesday, when he, another student and a teacher were wounded at Townville Elementary School, about 40 miles west of Greenville, S. C. A bullet struck the boy\u2019s leg as he burst through the school door for recess, striking his femoral artery.",
        "F \u201d this guy, ? the officer says before aiming his police cruiser at the mentally ill homeless man that he and his partner had been sent out to confront. I ?m going to hit him. ? Okay, \u00c2 go for it. Go for it, ? his partner responds, \u00c2 his voice recorded on the Sacramento police cruiser s dash cam. Twice, the man dodges their accelerating cruiser. In the second attempt, he leaps into a median, barely avoiding the vehicle. But Joseph Mann, 51, could not escape\u00c2 the volley of bullets that followed moments later.",
        "NICKEL MINES, Pa. \u2014 A single word in black cursive font hangs above a large window in Terri Roberts\u2019s sun room. It says \u201cForgiven. \u201d The word \u2014 and the room itself, a gift built by her Amish neighbors just months after the unimaginable occurred \u2014 is a daily reminder of all that she\u2019s lost and all that she\u2019s gained these past 10 years. The simple, quiet rural life she knew shattered on Oct. 2, 2006, when her oldest son, Charles Carl Roberts IV, walked into a Amish schoolhouse on a clear, unseasonably warm Monday morning.",
        "He was lounging in a hotel bed in Cincinnati when his phone rang. The Dallas Cowboys always knew they could reach him. Even at 7 a. m. on a Saturday. This was December 2012, and a team executive was calling. He spoke fast. Two players were missing. No one had heard from them since the previous night, and neither was answering his phone. The man in Cincinnati listened. He took notes. This David Wells isn\u2019t famous, but he might be the most influential figure for the NFL\u2019s most valuable franchise.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee have latched onto a newly hacked audio recording of Hillary Clinton critiquing Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign as a way to disrupt Clinton\u2019s outreach to reluctant young voters. But aides to Sanders\u2019s campaign have pushed back, criticizing how the audio has been covered and defending what Clinton said. The recording, first reported and uploaded by the Washington Free Beacon, was taken at a Feb. 16 fundraiser for Clinton at the McLean, Va. home of two diplomats.",
        "Explaining Donald Trump\u2019s appeal sits at the heart of understanding not only this election but, more broadly, the electorate that has produced this most unlikely of presidential candidates. The easy answer \u2014 and the one favored by many Democrats \u2014 is racism. Racial animus, they argue, is the thread that ties all of Trump\u2019s support together. I don\u2019t buy that. Sure, there is an element of racially coded language employed by Trump and, without doubt, there are avowed racists who support him. But, is everyone who supports Trump a racist? I find that very hard to believe.",
        "LONDON \u2014 London\u2019s property crisis is best seen at night, when entire streets in Central London are in the dark. Welcome to one of the world\u2019s most expensive places. Except that hardly anyone will be there to welcome you. Nearly half of all properties in Central London are owned by foreigners. Most of the owners do not live in their properties but rather use them as second homes or investment properties. Foreign ownership has driven up property prices immensely, and has made life in central districts almost impossible for many poorer Londoners who feel the fallout most severely."
