        "APARTADO, Colombia \u2014 On a high school basketball court in a rough town surrounded by banana plantations, two FARC guerrilla commanders came to apologize for a massacre. Nothing like that had ever happened in Colombia until last week. Sergio Jaramillo, the Colombian government\u2019s peace commissioner, came for the ceremony, too, patting the shoulders of the victims\u2019 relatives as they gave tearful accounts of lost husbands, fathers and sons. One of the relatives fainted. A few embraced the FARC leaders and wept.",
        "My children are 4, 2 and 8 weeks and they have yet to hear me use the S word: space. I swore 18 months ago when we moved into our that we would adopt a \u201chave\u201d rather than \u201chave not\u201d attitude. Growing up on stories that my grandfather, whose family of nine lived in a shtetl home in Poland where they perched his mattress on their stovetop to optimize space, I reminded myself that our limited conditions would be cozy, not claustrophobic.",
        "Happy Wednesday. Care for a cocktail? Spirits columnist M. Carrie Allan steps behind the bar this week to talk to women bartenders about the particular struggles they face in the workplace. Lots of reader comments on this one: See it all here. Also in Food, Tom Sietsema samples the food at the new National Museum of African American History and Culture, which served about 8, 500 patrons during its debut weekend. And Bonnie S.

        "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Colombian voters have rejected a peace deal with FARC rebels, a surprise outcome that risks prolonging a armed conflict, and in doing so tossed the peace process into chaos. By a razor margin of 50. 25 to 49. 75 percent, voters rejected the peace deal, a backlash that few were expecting. After nearly six years of negotiations, many handshakes and ceremonial signatures, Colombia\u2019s war is not over. Not even close. Surveys had predicted an easy win for the \u201cyes\u201d vote by a margin of 2 to 1.",
        "Donald Trump is scrambling to rescue his campaign after a week in which the Republican nominee\u2019s White House hopes were effectively set ablaze by his own erratic behavior and the discovery that he may not have paid federal income taxes for as many as 18 years. Reeling from a New York Times report that Trump may have canceled out years of income taxes by declaring a $916 million loss on his 1995 return, his allies mounted a vigorous defense Sunday by arguing that the revelation was proof of the businessman\u2019s \u201cgenius.",
        "TOLEDO \u2014 John Gillespie dug into his omelet with one hand and flipped through the Toledo Blade with the other. The news that Donald Trump had declared a $916 million loss in his 1995 tax return, and may have avoided paying income taxes for as many as 18 years, had made it to the front page of the local newspaper. Gillespie, 52, struggled to make sense of it. \u201cThis was in 1995?\u201d he asked, looking up from the diner counter.",
        "The Paris climate agreement, the world\u2019s strongest effort yet to try to curb the pace of climate change, sped even closer toward becoming active as India, the planet\u2019s emitter of greenhouse gases, formally joined the accord Sunday. The agreement, which 195 countries negotiated over two weeks in December, \u201centers into force\u201d when at least 55 of them representing 55 percent of global emissions, officially join the accord. For each, that process includes signing and domestically ratifying or otherwise accepting the agreement, and then depositing an \u201cinstrument of ratification\u201d at the United Nations.",
        "\u201cThe only news here,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign declared in an unsigned statement emailed late Saturday night, \u201cis that the more than alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that The New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests. \u201d No. The news \u2014 unrebutted by the Trump campaign as of this writing \u2014 is that Trump could have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years. Assuming that the claimed losses were legit, this would have been legal.",
        "Tom Wilson is chairman and chief executive officer of the Allstate Corporation and vice chairman of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce. For decades, corporations have been expected to concentrate on one mission: Maximizing profits for shareholders. While that might have been appropriate decades ago, it isn\u2019t now. The emphasis on profits has widened the trust gap between corporations and society, resulting in an adversarial relationship between the private and public sectors. Let me be clear: Shareholders must get a good return, but at the same time corporations must work to be a force for good in society.",
        "Rosy Scenario is alive and well. There is a long and dubious tradition among politicians of projecting high \u2014 usually unrealistic \u2014 rates of economic growth as a way of avoiding unpopular political choices. We can do everything, because rapid growth and torrents of tax revenue will pay the bills. That\u2019s Rosy\u2019s message, and Donald Trump has eagerly embraced it. What Trump proposes is a huge machine \u2014 a massive tax cut, financed mostly with borrowed money \u2014 masquerading as an economic policy.",
        "In pursuing his historic opening of relations with Cuba, President Obama has frequently pushed legal and political boundaries. Now congressional Republicans are up in arms about another such initiative: an airline travel agreement they say exposes the United States to dangerous security gaps at Cuban airports. Congressional committees charged with overseeing the Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration have engaged in a feud with the administration over security vulnerabilities at 10 Cuban airports that have begun direct flights to the United States.",
        "DONALD TRUMP has telegraphed his intentions, if not always consistently, to radically shift immigration policy and, in so doing, subvert America\u2019s vitality and international standing as a beacon of diversity and tolerance. While he cannot unilaterally undertake every change he proposes, there is plenty he can do, on his own, to overhaul America\u2019s approach to immigrants. His program would undercut the nation\u2019s economic prospects, its values and the vibrancy of its neighborhoods and communities.",
        "Donald J. Trump has now driven home, in a way no apologist, enabler or timid analyst can plausibly deny, that he is far too nasty, immature and frighteningly undisciplined to be president. And thanks to Hillary Clinton for the assist: By using the first debate to bring up the case of a Miss Universe who, Trump decided, had put on too much weight, the Democratic nominee unleashed the ugly inner Donald  \u201d the man whom the candidate and his handlers have been trying to hide.",

        "The death of a black teenager, who was fatally shot Saturday afternoon by a police officer after a car chase, drew an angry \u2014 albeit peaceful \u2014 crowd on the streets of south Los Angeles. Los Angeles police shot the after a traffic stop about 1 p. m. Officers tried to pull over a car with paper license plates, suspecting that the vehicle was stolen, according to a news release from the Los Angeles Police Department.

        "Almost three times as many Americans say Hillary Clinton won last Monday\u2019s debate than Donald Trump, with the Democratic nominee regaining a clear favorability advantage over the Republican, according to a new Washington News poll. Clinton was also seen as sticking more to the facts during the debate, with far more saying she mainly got facts right than Trump (54 to 29 percent). A larger share said Trump got the facts wrong in the debate (47 percent) with just over 3 in 10 saying he lied on purpose.",
        "Look. Donald Trump wasn\u2019t particularly good in the first presidential debate on Monday night. He looked lost at times. He looked angry at times. He got beat. But, he wasn\u2019t that bad. The people who were for him declared victory. Many establishment Republicans insisted to me he had driven the . argument that they believe to be his best message. If Trump had spent the rest of the week holed up in Trump Tower, things might not have been so bad \u2014 even with the debate loss. He, um, didn\u2019t do that.",
        "The Washington Redskins defense hasn\u2019t been pretty this season. It has had its lapses on third downs, its missed tackles on plays that should\u2019ve gone for losses and its blown coverages in the secondary for touchdowns. But when it desperately needed a stop, the defense has somehow produced a takeaway. In Sunday\u2019s game against the Cleveland Browns, the defense produced three consecutive takeaways in the second half to pull the team out of a rut.",
        "Barely a month into the new academic year, a Long Island high school community is reeling after four of its students were found dead, victims of what police suspect is violence. Police discovered the body of Nisa Mickens first, when on Sept. 13 a passing driver reported seeing her body on a road in Brentwood, a Long Island enclave about 45 miles east of Manhattan. Nisa had suffered lacerations and head trauma, police said. The county police commissioner would later say that her injuries were some of the worst he had ever seen.",
        "ADDIS ABABA, ETHI O PIA \u2014 Dozens of people died Sunday at a festival after security forces fired tear gas into a crowd during a political protest and provoked a stampede. Opposition leaders estimated at least 100 dead. Late Sunday, the regional government said 52 had been killed in the crush. The Irreecha thanksgiving festival of Ethiopia\u2019s Oromo people takes place in October every year, at the conclusion of the rainy season, at a sacred lake in the town of Bishoftu, about 25 miles southeast of the capital, Addis Ababa.",
        "When I was 18, my stepfather\u2019s brother had been on dialysis for just over a year. He was thin, he exercised regularly and he seemingly was in perfect health, but inexplicably his kidneys began to fail him. Although I was just about to leave for college, I\u2019d heard enough about the misery of dialysis to decide to get tested as a possible donor. In the back of my mind, I knew that the chances of our compatibility were incredibly low because we were not related by blood. Perhaps that made it easy for me to decide to get tested.",
        "One in a series on the clothes that made a statement at Paris Fashion Week. PARIS \u2014 The clothes mattered \u2014 but in the case of Christian Dior, the sentiment mattered more. When Maria Grazia Chiuri made her debut as the creative director of Dior Friday, she did so with an unequivocal statement about feminism. It was a driving force in conceptualizing the look of her collection. Feminism was referenced in bold letters on a worn by a model on her runway. Christian Dior 2017 collection.",
        "In 1995, Donald Trump was in the midst of a spending spree. He had recently bought a 727 jet for personal use, added a skyscraper to his Manhattan real estate portfolio and snapped up properties in Telluride, Colo. and Palm Beach, Fla. financial records show. That same year, he said he had negative $916 million in \u201cfederal adjusted gross income,\u201d a claim that gave him the prospect of avoiding federal income taxes for years to come. So how could he be thriving and avoiding taxes at the same time?",
        "The New York attorney general has notified Donald Trump that his charitable foundation is violating state law \u201d by soliciting donations without proper certification \u201d and ordered Trump s charity to stop its fundraising immediately, the attorney general s office said Monday.

        "SANTA FE, N. M. \u2014 For state lawmakers here who used to work with Gary Johnson, something is familiar about the former governor\u2019s baffled looks, which have turned into an embarrassment for his presidential campaign. Longtime state Sen. Stuart Ingle (R) recalled how Johnson, soon after taking office in 1995, mostly shrugged and stared during their first meeting together. As Ingle asked Johnson questions about his agenda, Ingle said, Johnson\u2019s most common refrain was, \u201cI don\u2019t know.",
        "FARMVILLE, Va. \u2014 When Joan Johns Cobbs was 13, her older sister, Barbara, took an incredible risk. Fed up with shabby conditions at their high school, Barbara Johns led the students on a walkout to demand better education. It was 1951, and the resulting court case became one of the pillars of Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court decision that ended school segregation nationwide. Farmville and Prince Edward County responded harshly, shutting down the public school system for five years, from 1959 to 1964, rather than letting whites and blacks attend together. Today, much has changed.",
        "What do most of the chief advisers and surrogates of the Trump campaign have in common? I\u2019m thinking of Chris Christie, Roger Ailes, Stephen Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Newt Gingrich. What could possibly unite this diverse group? They are white, (and older) males \u2014 not that there is anything wrong with that. They are almost psychotically sycophantic. (According to Gingrich, Donald Trump won an \u201cenormous, historic victory\u201d in the first presidential debate."
