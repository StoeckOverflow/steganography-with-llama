        "Is the notoriously litigious Donald Trump afraid of getting sued by . . . Donald Trump? If so, the plaintiff could have a pretty strong case. This weekend, Americans learned that Trump reported losses in 1995 so yuge that he may not have paid any federal income taxes for 18 years. The Trump campaign has apparently decided that the best defense for this behavior is a perversion of Judge Learned Hand\u2019s famous ruling on tax planning.",
        "Loretta E. Lynch is attorney general of the United States. Recent incidents in Charlotte, Tulsa and El Cajon, Calif. were just the latest in a long series of events that have left Americans feeling saddened, angry and confused about the meaning of justice in the United States. These traumas \u2014 which include the tragic deaths of civilians and appalling, premeditated attacks on police officers \u2014 have laid bare the fault lines of mistrust that too often separate law enforcement and communities of color.",
        "Carl Bildt is a former prime minister of Sweden and a contributing columnist for The Post. Observers in Europe are following America\u2019s election campaigns with disbelief, a good portion of dismay and distinctly growing apprehension. Campaigns are, of course, campaigns, and any seasoned politician or observer of politics knows that the relationship between the words of campaign and the deeds of office isn\u2019t always straight. That explains the muted reactions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s oscillations on trade policy.",
        "I know, I know, the point I\u2019m about to make is painfully obvious. But it is not in any sense trivial: If you care who wins the election next month, get off the couch, go down to your polling place and vote. National polls taken since last week\u2019s debate show Hillary Clinton with a solid lead over Donald Trump; a Consult poll released Monday morning, for example, put the gap at 6 points. New polls in swing states, including some that once looked favorable for Trump, also report that Clinton is now ahead.",
        "IN NO realm is the U. S. president more powerful than in matters of national security. A president may launch wars, conduct intelligence operations and strike deals with foreign governments with minimal checks from the courts and Congress. If he wished, a President Donald Trump could carry out \u2014 or at least order \u2014 many of the most extreme proposals he has tossed off during the election campaign. If Mr.",
        "U. S. relations fell to a new War low Monday as the Obama administration abandoned efforts to cooperate with Russia on ending the Syrian civil war and forming a common front against terrorists there, and Moscow suspended a landmark nuclear agreement. The latter move, scuttling a deal the two countries signed in 2000 to dispose of their stocks of plutonium, was largely symbolic. But it provided the Kremlin with an opportunity to cite a series of what it called \u201cunfriendly actions\u201d toward Russia \u2014 from and human rights sanctions to the deployment of NATO forces in the Baltics.",
        "(This article, originally posted Monday morning, was updated in the evening.) Hurricane Matthew remains an extremely powerful Category 4 hurricane, and it is hours away from producing a prolonged period of conditions in parts of Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica. Ultimately, those conditions will extend into the Bahamas. Some impacts along the U. S. East Coast now appear to be more likely as we look toward the weekend, although there is a large amount of uncertainty. While there is more suggestion of a coastal scrape than a landfall at this time, a U. S.",
        "The headline alone would send a shudder down the spine of most elected officials: \u201d\u2019Apprentice\u2019 cast and crew say Trump was lewd and sexist.\u201d That\u2019s the top of a story from the Associated Press posted Monday morning that details Trump\u2019s behavior toward women who both appeared and worked on his hit TV show \u201dThe Apprentice.\u201d The AP talked to 20(!) former contestants or crew members on the show including 12(!) who spoke on the record to the news organization. That\u2019s remarkable.",
        "Shortly after last week\u2019s presidential debate, people started to argue on Twitter that Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton, had won the debate. The #Trumpwon hashtag made its way to the top of Twitter\u2019s worldwide trending topics, demonstrating how many people cared about the results of the debate and wanted to argue that their candidate had won. Trump gleefully announced his status as No. 1 on Twitter trends, seeming to imply that this was evidence that he had won the confrontation.",
        "Two men who were held at a CIA prison in Afghanistan have told a human rights group that they were subjected to a version of waterboarding at a detention site where the agency has insisted the brutal method was never used. The allegations were detailed in a report released Monday by Human Rights Watch based on extensive interviews with two Tunisian men who were returned to that country last year after spending 13 years in U. S. custody, almost all of it at a prison complex at Bagram air base in Afghanistan.",
        "A resident of Maryland was charged with attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State by planning to kill a member of the U. S. military, federal officials said Monday. Federal agents picked up on the alleged plans of Nelash Mohamed Das \u2014 a citizen of Bangladesh living in Hyattsville \u2014 and placed him under surveillance. At one point, a confidential source provided Das with a gun, and on Sept. 30, he arrived at the Maryland address where he had been led to believe his target lived, according to federal officials.",
        "ADDIS ABABA, Ethi o pia \u2014 The sleek, white train glides through the hilly Ethiopian countryside, the first to travel this route in nearly a decade. The contrast is stark as the new, electric train passes carriages, oxen hauling plows and crowds of curious village children. But soon it crosses over a gleaming expressway and snakes past a row of newly erected wind turbines \u2014 all and, like the train, part of Ethiopia\u2019s ongoing effort to remake itself.",
        "For four years, Yee Xiong fought to put it all behind her. The sexual assault. The questions about what role she may have played in it. Two hung juries and, finally, a plea deal that sent her attacker to jail. Just when Xiong thought it was all over, it seems to be starting again. Xiong is now being sued for defamation by her attacker, Lang Her, who claims that she and her siblings tarnished his reputation when they called him a rapist online in reference to the assault.",
        "By all accounts, Kristen Jarvis, first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s former prefers to stay out of the spotlight. She rarely spoke about her position as Obama\u2019s personal aide until leaving the gig in April 2015. And even then, she was sure to stay on message. Since decamping for a job at the Ford Foundation in New York, Jarvis has remained snugly under the radar. That is, until TMZ got a hold of the details of her upcoming wedding. According to the website, Jarvis\u2019s bridal party will feature two famous faces: Malia and Sasha Obama.",
        "One in a series on the clothes that really popped at Paris Fashion Week. PARIS \u2014 Just give in already: Get a giant white shirt. Wrap it asymmetrically around your torso. Let it slouch off your shoulders. Hack off a sleeve and wear it like a decorative sling. The spring 2017 Ann Demeulemeester show was by no means the only place where models promenaded down a runway wearing oversized white shirts that looked as though they had been chopped, twisted, turned upside down or otherwise rendered nearly unrecognizable. But it might have been the best.",
        "SIRTE, Libya \u2014 From a distance, we could see the black shapes, no more than a wavy blur in the desert heat. We were on a lonely highway, driving from the Libyan city of Misurata to the Islamic State stronghold of Sirte. It was a journey through the topography of war and ambition. We dodged a crater from a mortar, then drove over countless bullet casings. From our windows, we saw the graffiti that rival militias scrawled on walls and billboards. The black shapes were becoming more focused, until they were sharp as the sun\u2019s rays.",
        "The two candidates got into a bitter exchange about an excerpt from the speech that launched Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, in which Trump said that undocumented immigrants from Mexico were \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cbringing crime. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not a polished politician, like you and Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Gov. Mike Pence (Ind.) Trump\u2019s running mate, in the only debate of the season. \u201cHe is showing you who is he is,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) a few moments later, saying that Trump\u2019s comments about Mexicans showed his true character. \u201cSenator, you whipped out that Mexican thing again,\u201d Pence said.",
        "Democrats on Tuesday seized on comments Donald Trump made suggesting that military members and veterans with mental health issues are not \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t handle it,\u201d remarks they said render him out of touch and unfit to be commander in chief. The Republican presidential nominee, speaking to a group of veterans in Virginia on Monday, said that some troops see things in combat that \u201ca lot of folks in the room\u201d have seen many times. \u201cAnd you\u2019re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can\u2019t handle it,\u201d Trump said.",
        "As Donald Trump slumps in the polls and spins from one controversy to another, many of his supporters are even angrier than before at his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. For years, they have not liked or trusted her \u2014 many say it\u2019s fair to describe their feelings as hatred \u2014 and the nine days since Trump\u2019s poor debate performance have only confirmed and intensified their feelings.",
        "BREMEN, Germany \u2014 Since his arrest on terrorism charges, German militant Harry Sarfo has been an unusually talkative Islamic State recruit, granting interviews from prison that were carried on front pages and news broadcasts across Europe and the United States. German authorities permitted the access to Sarfo, whose story seemed to represent such a cautionary tale. He described atrocities he witnessed in Syria and the Islamic State\u2019s efforts to enlist him for plots in Europe, always emphasizing that he spurned these approaches before making an improbable escape.",
        "Hurricane Matthew slammed into the southwestern coast of Haiti early Tuesday, unleashing 145 mph winds and torrential rains that threatened to wreak new devastation across a country still reeling from a ruinous earthquake six years ago. The eye of the Category 4 storm made landfall around 7 a. m. Eastern time, near the coastal commune of Les Anglais, the U. S. National Hurricane Center reported. Matthew reached the eastern tip of Cuba \u2014 site of the U. S. Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and military prison \u2014 Tuesday evening en route to a projected collision with the U. S.",
        "Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality. Eighteen years? He paid no taxes? Are you sure this is standard practice? No wonder he won\u2019t release his returns. The bigger the losses, the more he earns. Airline, Trump U, and casinos All went but he knows Loss is gain. My projection: He\u2019ll make money from a lost election. It\u2019s been one first after another. First candidate to offer a health plan described only as really \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cunbelievable. \u201d First ever to brag about his penis. First to be endorsed by the National Enquirer.",
        "\u201cCatastrophic\u201d is the word several U. S. officials use privately to discuss the latest developments in Syria, in which a savage Russian bombing campaign has brought Aleppo near the point of surrender. Yet even as members of the Obama administration acknowledge the horror, they remain wary of options that might counter the onslaught. Whatever else U. S. officials say about Syria, they should begin with an admission that we are diminished, as individuals and as a nation, by watching the destruction of a city and its people.",
        "IT TOOK global negotiators a to strike the Paris climate agreement, an international accord aimed at slowing global warming. The agreement represents the best hope for a world in which no one country acting alone can do enough to fight this global threat. Donald Trump could destroy the agreement with a stroke of a pen, and with it any hope that the world will keep the planet\u2019s temperature within the boundaries scientists say are safe. The Paris deal represents a major U. S. commitment, but it is not a treaty with the force of law.",
        "My favorite bumper sticker I\u2019ve never seen: Commas matter. So I\u2019ve always thought, and do still believe with the passion of one whose knuckles were rapped for grammatical errors. I mean this only metaphorically \u2014 no bloody fingers \u2014 but using incorrect grammar was the eighth deadly sin in my childhood home. How grateful I am that this was so. And now I have a confession: I\u2019ve begun to forget the rules. What used to come naturally has become a test of recall. Does a comma go here? Should I use the Oxford comma?",
        "The big topic that the big discussions love to talk around is wealth inequality. We are like the alcoholic that doesn\u2019t want to admit we have a problem.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s the job of the press to question and to keep questioning. \u201d Ask Rob Reiner a question, and you will get a lengthy and passionate answer. The ninth episode of \u201cCape Up\u201d is an impromptu conversation with the actor, director and activist, who just happened to be in the District last month scouting locations for his movie \u201cShock and Awe. \u201d He said the forthcoming film is about the to the Iraq War and the journalists who \u201cgot everything right. \u201d LISTEN HERE: For more conversations like this, subscribe to \u201cCape UP\u201d on iTunes or Stitcher.",
        "Yahoo in April of last year began secretly scanning the incoming emails of its hundreds of millions of users to comply with an order from the U.

        "Even in the most carefree times, a children\u2019s bed fashioned after a missile launcher would probably raise eyebrows. But a Russian furniture company has drawn ire for selling a bed frame resembling the Buk missile system that a inquiry has concluded shot down a passenger plane over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. [Report: Missile brought from Russia downed Malaysia Airlines plane over Ukraine] \u201dIs this some kind of joke?\u201d Russian journalist Oleg Kashin remarked in a post on his Facebook page, touching off a string of outraged comments as Russian media picked up the story.",
        "When the winners of the 2016 Nobel Prize in physics were announced Tuesday, some folks in the science community were disappointed that the honor had not gone to the researchers behind this year\u2019s historic detection of gravitational waves. It would have been a big, splashy prize for a remarkable discovery \u2014 and the rare case of a nearly immediate Nobel nod. But because the results of that study were not published until after the deadline for 2016 nominations, the committee has a valid excuse."
