        "Maybe it was that time you took the kids to the amusement park, and on the way home \u2014 their adorable faces still sticky from the slushies you\u2019d sprung for, their little wrists adorned with pricey passes \u2014 they asked to stop for ice cream.",
        "LONDON \u2014 The expectations were breathless. For weeks, backers of Republican nominee Donald Trump hyped the tantalizing possibility that the organization WikiLeaks was on the verge of publishing a set of documents that would doom Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in November. \u201c@HillaryClinton is done,\u201d longtime Trump associate Roger Stone tweeted Saturday. \u201c#Wikileaks. \u201d The group\u2019s founder, Julian Assange, did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm, suggesting to Fox News hosts that his scoops could upend the race with documents \u201cassociated with the election campaign, some quite unexpected angles, some quite interesting.",
        "By the time Ava Christianson got to the National Institutes of Health this summer, she had lost several grueling rounds to leukemia and was bracing for the next one. Intensive chemotherapy, which cures up to 90 percent of children with the most common type of leukemia, hadn\u2019t kept her cancer from coming back. Neither had a painful transplant nor an experimental treatment. Her careworn father cried in the shower to hide his anguish. Her mother couldn\u2019t help but wonder, \u201cWhy is this happening to our child?\u201d But Ava was fortunate in one respect.",
        "The Army\u2019s Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps, a military leadership program, has overhauled its weapons training procedures on the nation\u2019s college campuses after cadet drills \u2014 including one at George Mason University \u2014 were mistaken for possible attacks. Maj. Gen. Christopher P. Hughes last week ordered all 275 Army ROTC units and 700 other affiliated programs to use extra precaution during training exercises that involve the use of realistic rifle replicas and furtive movements that could be mistaken for a threat to the community.",
        "Gloria Naylor, whose 1982 debut novel, \u201cThe Women of Brewster Place,\u201d won a National Book Award and launched her to the fore of a wave of acclaimed black female writers that included Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, died Sept. 28 at her home in the U. S. Virgin Islands town of Christiansted. She was 66. The cause was a heart attack, said her literary agent, Sterling Lord. As a novelist, Ms.",
        "One in a series on the clothes that made a splash at Paris Fashion Week. PARIS \u2014 Designer Rei Kawakubo invited her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons audience to one of the neighborhoods of Paris, a place where residents comb through discount bins looking at 3 euro trying to figure out how to make such throwaway garments work for them. That journey away from this city\u2019s grand mansions was a reminder that the clothes we wear more often than not are intimately connected to where we live, with whom we interact and the community we call home.",
        "BOSTON \u2014 A federal contractor suspected in the leak of powerful National Security Agency hacking tools has been arrested and charged with stealing classified information from the U. S. government, according to court records and U. S. officials familiar with the case. Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, who did technology work for Booz Allen Hamilton, was charged with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials, authorities said. According to two U. S.",
        "Four years ago, President Obama was in somewhat the same position that Donald Trump is in now. Obama\u2019s first debate against GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney had gone badly, and advice was flooding in from all directions. But one suggestion really hit home, Obama\u2019s former chief speechwriter Jon Favreau recalled. \u201cYou don\u2019t win the second debate,\u201d former president Bill Clinton told Obama, \u201cby relitigating the first one. \u201d Trump might also do well to heed that counsel \u2014 especially because the next debate, on Sunday night in St. Louis, will be conducted in a style format.",
        "It was just after midnight Tuesday at James Madison University when the clown calls started pouring in. Phones beeped and buzzed. There was no official alert at the Harrisonburg, Va. school, but on Yik Yak, Twitter and GroupMe, students learned of a possible intruder on campus. A grainy Snapchat video purported to show a menacing clown outside of Weaver Hall. Freakout ensued. Some students panicked; others were just wary. No one really thought it was funny. In minutes, undergrad posses carrying flashlights and pepper spray roamed the Quad, seeking to capture the clown or at least chase it off.",
        "BOSTON \u2014 Retired Marine Corps Sgt. John Peck is crying as he lies on the operating table, the stumps of his arms anesthetized, the room filled with lights and figures in blue scrubs. He\u2019s been praying since his plane left Virginia the night before, asking for strength. And a nurse keeps trying to comfort him. But the weight of what\u2019s happening has hit him, and for the moment he is overcome. It\u2019s been six years since he stepped on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan and became a quadruple amputee.",
        "A powerful hurricane expected to grow stronger continued to march toward the Southeastern United States on Wednesday, as authorities in states readying for the storm\u2019s devastating combination of winds and rain declared emergencies, ordered evacuations and shuttered schools. After Hurricane Matthew pummeled Haiti on Tuesday \u2014 causing at least 11 deaths there and in the Dominican Republic, officials said, with the full toll still unknown \u2014 it weakened slightly before continuing on to the Bahamas and barreling onward to Florida, where forecasters warn it could lead to \u201c \u201d along the state\u2019s eastern coast.",
        "Now that the GOP is the Party of Trump, could Democrats become the party of . . . Reagan? That\u2019s a stretch. But Democrats are making a bid for the title. At Tuesday night\u2019s debate, the 40th president was twice \u2014 both times by the Democrat, Tim Kaine. \u201cOur plan is like Ronald Reagan\u2019s plan from 1986,\u201d Kaine said on immigration. The Republican, Mike Pence, countered that \u201cRonald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation.",
        "MANCHESTER, N. H. Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( . H.) has tried for months to walk a high wire on the vexing subject of Donald Trump. This week, she fell off. Her tumble, on what most of us would see as an easy question about whether Trump should be regarded as a \u201crole model,\u201d came during a debate Monday night with Gov. Maggie Hassan, her Democratic opponent. They are locked in an excruciatingly close Senate race.",
        "THE DECADES since the end of the Cold War have seen strong and widely shared economic growth, on a global scale. The portion of the world\u2019s population living on $1. 25 per day or less fell from 44 percent to 23 percent. Some 200 million Chinese, 90 million Indians and 30 million people each in Indonesia, Egypt and Brazil moved into the global middle class.",
        "Robert E. Rubin, of the Council on Foreign Relations, was U. S. treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999. The progress our economy has made since the financial crisis is real. So, too, is the sense that our country is adrift. Faith in institutions is eroding. Income inequality, job insecurity and sluggish wage growth \u2014 even with 2015\u2019s improved performance \u2014 are fraying our social fabric. Technological development and, to a lesser extent, globalization contribute to productivity and growth but also put pressure on wages and jobs. The poverty rate is unconscionably high.",
        "The \u201cquiet catastrophe\u201d is particularly dismaying because it is so quiet, without social turmoil or even debate. It is this: After 88 consecutive months of the economic expansion that began in June 2009, a smaller percentage of American males in the prime working years (ages 25 to 54) are working than were working near the end of the Great Depression in 1940, when the unemployment rate was above 14 percent. If the participation rate were as high today as it was as recently as 2000, nearly 10 million more Americans would have jobs.",
        "Nearly 19, 000 people lost their lives to opioid overdoses in 2014, a quadrupling of these deaths in just 15 years. The devastation wrought by the prescription opioid crisis, and the subsequent related epidemic of addiction to chemically similar heroin, is spreading anguish across America. Government\u2019s response so far consists mainly of damage control \u2014 more drug treatment, distributing overdose antidotes to first responders. Fundamental change might be on the way, however, depending on what happens during the coming weeks in an unlikely locale: the Hinds County courthouse in Jackson, Miss.",
        "EREZ, Israel \u2014 It\u2019s not easy to get out of Gaza, not easy at all. Israel allows the very sick to visit Israeli hospitals, for chemotherapy or dialysis or surgery. It sometimes permits mourners to attend funerals of close relatives. Most of the permissions go to Gazan traders, who import Israeli goods into the besieged enclave. Two years ago, Israeli authorities created a new category: pilgrims. A few hundred elderly Palestinians may now exit the coastal strip on Fridays and take the bus trip to Jerusalem to pray at Mosque, the site in Islam.",
        "Marijuana advocates are heading into the final weeks of the 2016 campaign with the wind at their backs as the latest polling shows legalization measures currently favored by voters in all five states where they\u2019re on the ballot. This is something of a reversal from just a month ago, when the most recent polling had shown voters wary of legalization measures in Massachusetts and Arizona. But the margins of support aren\u2019t huge in any state, meaning that the contests could still swing either way.",
        "Super PACs seeking to influence the 2016 elections have collected more than $1 billion, a record haul driven by contributions from rich donors on both sides of the aisle. Just 10 individuals and couples contributed nearly 20 percent of the $1. 1 billion raised by super PACs by the end of August, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal campaign finance reports. The total exceeds the $853 million that super PACs collected in the entire 2012 cycle.",
        "Literally everyone needs to calm down about this election. Few people need to calm down more immediately and more substantially than me, so I acknowledge the irony of my calling you out for the same thing. But we\u2019ve entered that phase of the presidential contest in this age when a percentage of Americans demand of everyone around them new information about the likely outcome even when it\u2019s obvious that nothing has actually changed. This is the moment for which The Fix was created.",
        "The world will be watching from when the United States chooses a president next month, as foreign election observers fan out to polling places across the country. For the first time, the Organization of American States (OAS) will dispatch 30 to 40 observers and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which has been sending small groups of observers to U. S. elections since 2002, hopes to boost its contingent dramatically, fielding hundreds of poll watchers. Even Russia, where 63 U. S.",
        "SAN FRANCISCO Samsung, the largest maker of televisions and smartphones in the world, is buying Viv Labs, a artificial intelligence startup founded by the inventors of Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant, the South Korean electronics conglomerate said Wednesday. The move is a major land grab in the battle for artificial intelligence taking place among tech giants. Samsung, which has lagged in such services, is now positioned to add intelligent, voice capabilities to its vast collection of home and mobile electronics.",
        "The United Nations Security Council on Wednesday endorsed Portugal\u2019s Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, a former prime minister and former head of the U. N. refu gee agency, to be the world body\u2019s next secretary general. The full General Assembly is scheduled to vote Thursday on the Security Council\u2019s recommendation that Guterres succeed South Korean Ban when he steps down at the end of the year after two terms. Russia\u2019s U. N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, who is the council president for the month of October, said he hoped Guterres would win by acclamation.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court on Wednesday began weighing what has become one of the most troubling questions on Wall Street: When does sharing confidential corporate information with a family member become a crime? Insider trading has been long been the epitome of Wall Street wrongdoing, but prosecutors and defense attorneys have been arguing for years over how it is defined and when someone should face prison for it. In this case, Salman v.",
        "\u201cHonor killings\u201d persist in Pakistan. Almost always, the victim is a woman; the killer a man. The woman\u2019s offense is invariably refusing to bend to the will of her family. \u201cShe is a sister who falls in love with a man not of her family\u2019s choosing,\u201d as the AP\u2019s Kathy Gannon wrote in a remarkable story this week. \u201cShe is a daughter who refuses to agree to an arranged marriage, sometimes to a man old enough to be her father. She is a wife who can no longer stay in an abusive marriage and divorces her husband.",
        "A specter is haunting professional football. The specter of simulated violence. For too long, we\u2019ve sat idly by while giant, hulking men simulated potentially violent acts during stoppages in play. That\u2019s not funny, and it\u2019s not right. No one goes to a sporting event to see violence \u2014 simulated or otherwise. I\u2019m writing this now, of course, because Redskins cornerback Josh Norman was penalized last week for simulating violence, and some barbaric enthusiasts archery cultists disagreed with that call. They are under the mistaken impression that violence is okay. It is not.",
        "One in a series on the clothes that had a big moment at Paris Fashion Week. PARIS \u2014 The Lanvin collection for spring 2017 was beautiful. Which was no small feat. It was the debut of designer Bouchra Jarrar, who came to the company after the shocking and ugly firing of longtime creative director Alber Elbaz, who gave the brand its modern definition, proved himself as a kind and empathetic aesthetic counselor to women and helped Lanvin churn its way to $250 million in annual revenue at its peak. Lanvin 2017 collection.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: Some images in this post may be disturbing due to their graphic nature. It is said that Torajans are people who \u201clive to die. \u201d For this Indonesian ethnic group, funerals are such extravagant events that they sometimes attract tourists. Families can postpone burials years (and the deceased are considered sick and hosted at home until the funeral) until the family can raise enough money and gather as many relatives as possible. And then it\u2019s a jubilant multiday social event with a parade, dances and animal sacrifices.",
        "On Sunday, India ratified its accession to the Paris climate accords on the 147th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. President Obama congratulated India in a tweet, saying that \u201dGandhiji believed in a world worthy of our children. In joining the Paris Agreement, @narendramodi & the Indian people carry on that legacy,\u201d using a Hindi honorific for the man who championed Indian and stewardship of its land. The Paris agreement is the international community\u2019s biggest push yet to limit carbon emissions and other forms of pollution."
