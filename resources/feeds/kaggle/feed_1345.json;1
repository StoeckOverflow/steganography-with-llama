        "In 1986, President Ronald Reagan and Congress came together to pass a landmark tax reform bill that streamlined tax brackets, cut rates, closed loopholes and eliminated tax breaks. Reagan declared it \u201ca sweeping victory for fairness. \u201d Donald Trump, however, wanted the loopholes and tax breaks back. In testimony before a House Budget Committee task force in November 1991, Trump called the 1986 tax reform legislation an \u201cabsolute catastrophe\u201d that had pushed the real estate business into an \u201cabsolute depression.",
        "Donald Trump and his allies signaled Thursday that he is ready to move past the controversies that have dominated the 10 days since the first presidential debate and that he will try to stay focused on policy, not attacks, at the second debate on Sunday. The Republican presidential nominee appeared more controlled on the campaign trail on Wednesday and Thursday than he was last week, sticking with scripted speeches, mostly avoiding interviews and sending tweets that appeared to have been closely edited, if not entirely composed, by his staff.",
        "A budding civil war between two of Fox News Channel\u2019s leading personalities went public Wednesday night. The object of their dispute: Donald Trump. Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity publicly fired back at his colleague Megyn Kelly after Kelly said on her program that Donald Trump will only appear on Hannity\u2019s show in order to avoid tough interviews or \u201cunsafe spaces. \u201d Hannity replied testily to her on Twitter, tweeting \u201cu should be mad at @hillaryClinton. Clearly you support her. And @realDonaldTrump did talk to u.",
        "Hillary Clinton wants to make one thing very, very clear: Tim Kaine was GREAT in Tuesday\u2019s debate. So good. The best. He might have, in fact, added his name to the list of the world\u2019s greatest debaters \u2014 right there alongside Abraham Lincoln, Socrates and Winston Churchill. This is what\u2019s commonly known as overcompensating. Like if people say you are dumb, you try to wedge lots of big words into every sentence you write. That sort of sesquipedalianism is, of course, a tell for overcompensation.",
        "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2014 The strongest storm system to threaten the United States in a decade roared toward Florida on Thursday, forcing thousands from their homes and prompting dire warnings from forecasters and public officials alike. Floridians hunkered down Thursday as pelting rain and punishing wind began to pummel the state, the first sting of a deadly hurricane expected to grind its way up the coast overnight and through most of the day Friday. Gov. Rick Scott (R) repeatedly pleaded with residents to take the storm seriously, urging the 1.",
        "(This story has been updated.) A vast stretch of Florida\u2019s east coast faces its most extreme hurricane threat in modern history. Computer model forecasts have converged on the idea that Hurricane Matthew, which is intensifying, will directly strike the area between roughly West Palm Beach and the Georgia border. Packing maximum winds of 140 mph and stronger gusts, Matthew is poised to become the first Category 4 or stronger storm to make landfall in this region since records began in 1851. Hurricane Matthew heads towards Florida and is expected to make landfall overnight.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The \u201cart of the deal,\u201d in Donald Trump\u2019s version, has a hard edge. It involves public bluster, threats of litigation and confrontational negotiations. It\u2019s about winning rather than compromise. But there\u2019s another version of dealmaking that\u2019s more relevant to how Washington actually works. It\u2019s about passing budgets and avoiding shutdowns. It involves creating space for agreement on taxes and spending. These negotiations usually take place out of public view. And they\u2019re shaped by one of Washington\u2019s most powerful but least understood institutions, the Office of Management and Budget.",
        "A PRESIDENT TRUMP could alter the face of this country and its role in the world, in many cases with Congress and the courts having little power to check him. In a series of editorials over the past several days, we have described the vast reach of executive power in areas where Mr. Trump has made his intentions clear. He could, in fact, unilaterally order mass deportations, resume torturing detainees, undo the preservation of natural treasures and tear up trade agreements.",
        "Desmond Tutu is archbishop emeritus of Cape Town and a Nobel Peace laureate. Throughout my life, I have been fortunate to have spent my time working for dignity for the living. I have campaigned passionately for people in my country and the world over to have their rights. I have been fortunate to have long spent my time working for dignity for the living. Now, with my life closer to its end than its beginning, I wish to help give people dignity in dying.",
        "Only amid the most bizarre, most tawdry, most addictive election campaign in memory could the real story of 2016 be so effectively obliterated, namely, that with just four months left in the Obama presidency, its two central pillars are collapsing before our eyes: domestically, its radical reform of American health care, a. k. a. Obamacare; and abroad, its radical reorientation of American foreign policy \u2014 disengagement marked by diplomacy and multilateralism. Obamacare. On Monday, Bill Clinton called it \u201cthe craziest thing in the world.",
        "Tuesday\u2019s encounter between Tim Kaine and Mike Pence was substantive at times and contentious throughout. But the eminences who run the Commission on Presidential Debates should ask themselves this question: Why have a debate at all? Of course there should be some sort of public forum for voters to get to know the individuals who might find themselves, as the cliche goes, a heartbeat away from the presidency. But the debate format told us little about Kaine and Pence that we didn\u2019t already know.",
        "PHILADELPHIA  Amanda is a liberal, idealistic,   master s      single mother who has voted for Barack Obama. She cares about climate change, child care, affordable health care, police brutality, public nutrition. Policy specifics matter to her.  On paper, she is the kind of millennial voter whom Hillary Clinton should have in the bag, wrapped up with a tight little bow.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Cardinal Timothy Dolan said Thursday that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has created an compensation program for people who were sexually abused by church leaders, likely the first of its kind in the nation. Abuse survivors who are willing to waive the right to sue could in exchange receive financial compensation at an amount set by an independent mediator, a plan that mirrors compensation funds used in the wake of national tragedies and major scandals. One of the mediators the archdiocese has hired, Kenneth Feinberg, also set compensation amounts for victims of the Sept.",
        "President Obama granted clemency to another 102 inmates Thursday as he continued to release federal inmates serving long prison terms for nonviolent drug offenses. Obama has now commuted the sentences of 774 federal inmates, more than the previous 11 presidents combined. With 590 commutations this year, he has commuted the most individuals\u2019 sentences in one year in U. S. history, White House officials said. They said Obama will continue granting commutations to federal drug offenders through the remainder of his time in office.",
        "To announce that he doesn\u2019t plan to bring up Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual history during the next presidential debate, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reached out to \u2014 Page Six. Page Six is the epicenter of juicy New York gossip, and the tidbit about Trump appeared online Thursday alongside these headlines: \u201cKim Kardashian in the market for a body double\u201d and \u201cDorinda Medley allegedly attacks banker with high heel.",
        "A woman her age is supposed to be invisible. But Hillary Clinton, who is 68, refuses to disappear \u2014 and there is no shortage of people who despise her for it. One voter at a Donald Trump rally described her to The Washington Post\u2019s Jenna Johnson last week as \u201can angry, crotchety old hag. \u201d Trump, who isn\u2019t exactly a spring chicken at age 70, claims Clinton lacks \u201cstamina\u201d and a \u201cpresidential look\u201d and mocked her by acting out her stumble when she had pneumonia last month. There\u2019s misogyny, and then there\u2019s the ageist misogyny that older women face.",
        "It was just the kind of moment Democrats long expected: Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( . H.) asked at a Monday debate whether she would tell a child to aspire to be like Donald Trump, hemmed and hawed before declaring, \u201cAbsolutely, I would do that. \u201d Her opponent, Gov. Maggie Hassan, and Democratic groups instantly pounced on the misstep, posting web ads highlighting Trump\u2019s controversies and blasting out emails about the comment.",
        "KATWE, Uganda \u2014 Richard Buyinza stared at the chessboard in front of him, plotting what he hoped would be his killer move. Around him in the cramped, dimly lit room, more than a dozen youngsters were hunched on wooden benches, equally intent on strategy. Outside, small rivers of runoff and sewage scarred the dirt alley, turned to mud from a recent rain. The room was silent except for the tapping of plastic chess pieces being moved. Finally, Buyinza and his opponent reached a stalemate. Without a word, they reset their board and prepared for a new game.",
        "On a humid day in April 2009, the sound of gunfire drew police to a suburban home in Jefferson Parish, La. Officers found no shooters or victims \u2014 just an empty back yard littered with shell casings. In an area with the nation\u2019s highest rate, the incident seemed pretty minor. \u201c case\u201d is how one detective described it. Still, the casings were taken to the crime lab and entered into a huge federal database run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
        "A commuter train that barreled into a Hoboken, N. J. rail terminal last month was going double the speed limit when it crashed, federal officials said Thursday. The National Transportation Safety Board said the train was traveling at 21 mph, citing information downloaded from a data recorder in the train\u2019s leading car. In interviews with investigators over the weekend, engineer Thomas Gallagher, 48, who has no memory of the crash, recalled pulling into the station about 10 mph. The next thing he remembered was waking up on the floor of the train cab.",
        "Clay Tumey visited his Texas bank to make a withdrawal, but he left with a discovery that convinced him of one thing: He could rob banks and probably get away with it. The flash came a decade ago after he glimpsed blurry photos of himself captured by the branch\u2019s surveillance system. He figured that no stranger would be able to identify him from such poor images. Tumey was no criminal at that time, but the insight started him on a path to carrying out a string of bank robberies.",
        "Long before federal judge Damon Keith became known as a \u201ccrusader for justice,\u201d he was a new Howard University School of Law graduate working as a janitor while he studied for the bar exam. It was 1949, and Keith cleaned the bathrooms at the Detroit News, his hometown newspaper. One day, Keith recalled, he was leaning against a wall in the men\u2019s room with a law dictionary in his hands when he was interrupted. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d a white reporter asked him.",
        "PARIS \u2014 Joy. Is it so hard to come by? Not contentment, which implies something more enduring, something that comes from within (although perhaps with the help of a therapist). Joy comes in a jolt, a sudden flush of pleasure. It may be momentary, but it\u2019s real. This is the business of fashion. It should be able to put a smile on your face. Lately, though, it has been a struggle.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: Some images in this post may be disturbing because of their graphic nature. Members of the National Guard team with rescue volunteers to locate trapped animals. (Carol Washington Post) In 2005, when many people were faced with the impossible decision of whether to be rescued from the impending churn of Hurricane Katrina but abandon their pets, or be left behind, many chose the former. Some people thought they would only be away for a few days. And shelters, including those of the American Red Cross, were refusing to take animals.",
        "Donald Trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone, saying that \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it,\u201d according to a video obtained by The Washington Post. The video captures Trump talking with Billy Bush, then of \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d on a bus with the show\u2019s name written across the side. They were arriving on the set of \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d to tape a segment about Trump\u2019s cameo on the soap opera.",
        "As Donald Trump jetted to Colorado on Monday, his presidential campaign was on life support. His momentum had been zapped by a turbulent week, bookended by an unsteady debate and an erratic display at his last rally. In Washington, GOP leaders were analyzing internal polls that charted a Trump collapse in nearly every swing state. Aboard his plush Boeing 757, the Republican nominee and his closest advisers charted a plan to stabilize the campaign.",
        "The Obama administration on Friday officially accused Russia of carrying out a campaign to interfere with the 2016 elections, including by hacking the computers of the Democratic National Committee and other political officials. The denunciation, made by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, came as pressure was growing from within the administration and some lawmakers to hold Moscow accountable for a set of actions apparently aimed at sowing discord around the election. The DNC publicly disclosed the intrusions in June, saying their investigation determined Russian government hackers were behind it.",
        "ORMOND BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Hurricane Matthew churned along Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast Friday, looking increasingly like its center would remain just offshore as the storm battered the state with punishing rain, sea surges and destructive wind gusts topping 100 mph. Even if Matthew avoids making landfall and Florida dodges some of the scenarios laid out by forecasters and public officials in recent days, it still poses a considerable threat to residents from Florida to North Carolina.",
        "CHANTAL, Haiti \u2014 As the creek behind Hermosante Fedna\u2019s home overflowed its banks and lapped at her walls, she waited, afraid the hurricane winds outside posed the greater danger. She and her husband, Tiophal Sintable, had built their home and raised seven children there. He grew rice and cassava in the green coastal fields behind it. She sold them in the market. But the sounds Monday night were tremendous, like roaring engines. The winds uprooted towering palm trees and hurled them into the shacks all around her. Coconuts landed like cannonballs.",
        "Some thoughts on the significance, moral and political, of Donald Trump\u2019s recorded comments about women \u2014 what parts of them he likes, and what parts his star power enables him to grab at will: First \u2014 and this is in no way to diminish the offensiveness of Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 let\u2019s guard against being terribly shocked, shocked, that there is sexist, and sexual, commentary going on in private, or what fools like Trump assume is private despite the unfortunate fact that they are miked up."
