        "Amanda L. Jacobsen, a law faculty member at the University of Copenhagen, faculty of Law, and Joseph Margulies, a professor of law and government at Cornell University, are lawyers for Guantanamo Bay detainee Abu Zubaydah. The poster child of the American torture program sits in a Guantanamo Bay prison cell, where many U. S. officials hope he will simply be forgotten. But blood always leaves a stain, and the mark on our conscience and law will remain until we reckon with the case of Zayn Muhammad Husayn, known to the world as Abu Zubaydah.",
        "\u201cThis was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course \u2014 not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended. \u201d \u2014 Donald Trump, apologizing(?) for leaked footage of him talking to Billy Bush in 2005, saying that, among other things, \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star they let you do it,\u201d Trump says. \u201cYou can do anything \u2026 Grab them by the p \u2014 y,\u201d Trump says. \u201cYou can do anything. \u201d Ah, yes, just locker room banter.",
        "Vladimir Putin\u2019s serial humiliations of America\u2019s bewildered secretary of state regarding Syria indicate Putin\u2019s determination to destabilize the world. Here is an even more ominous indication of events moving his way: On just one day last week, Italian ships plucked 6, 055 migrants from the Mediterranean. What has this to do with Putin? It portends fulfillment of his aspiration for Europe\u2019s political, social and moral disorientation. The Financial Times reports that of the 138, 000 migrants who have come by sea to Italy this year, few are from Syria.",
        "Deborah Tannen is a linguistics professor at Georgetown University and author of \u201cYou Just Don\u2019t Understand\u201d and \u201cThe Argument Culture. \u201d Interruptions are a staple of political debates, as we saw in the first presidential and the . Judging by the column inches, screen space and private conversations devoted to these interruptions, it\u2019s clear that many viewers expect candidates to speak only during their allotted time. But that is no longer the norm. In the past, great communicators were great orators, but great communicators today sound conversational, and interrupting is common in conversation.",
        "More than two years have passed, but thoughts of what little Relisha Rudd may have gone through while in the hands of her kidnapper, Kahlil Tatum, continue to torment. It matters not that Tatum was found dead from a gunshot after Rudd\u2019s disappearance. Or that his wife, Andrea Kelly Tatum, also was found shot to death with the gun authorities believe Tatum used on himself. Relisha has never been found. D. C. residents should be haunted by this story. This girl and her family were wards of the city in the D. C.",
        "Mylan reached a $465 million settlement with the Justice Department to \u201dresolve questions that have been raised\u201d about whether the Medicaid program overpaid for the lifesaving allergy injection, the company said in a release Friday afternoon. In recent weeks, many politicians have called for investigations into whether EpiPen was improperly classified in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Under the rebate program, the EpiPen has been classified as a \u201d drug,\u201d which means the company is required to pay only a 13 percent rebate. In contrast, brand name or drugs with a single source must pay a 23.",
        "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 In four years as CEO of USA Track and Field, Max Siegel has built a reputation as a savvy who has raised so much money the Olympic sports nonprofit finally can offer decent pay to some Team USA athletes, many of whom scrape by on annual incomes of $20, 000 or less. Within the track and field community, however, Siegel is a polarizing figure.",
        "The interview had gone on for nearly an hour when Taim, a slim, boy, started to fidget. The asked for paper and settled back in an oversized hotel chair to draw a memory. His picture, in a child\u2019s bold scrawl, was a scene from the small park near his house, a place where he used to play in the days before the bearded men with guns took over the city. A crowd in the park had gathered around two figures, and Taim remembered them vividly: A man with one eye, and a bald man who seemed upset about something.",
        "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Sherrod Brown won seven terms in the U. S. House and two terms in the Senate by campaigning against \u201cjob killing\u201d international trade deals. He has prodded presidents from both parties over their support for NAFTA, CAFTA and expanded trade with China. But he has never, in nearly 25 years in Washington, actually won a congressional battle over a major trade agreement. This year, it looks like that losing streak will end. The politics of globalization have swung quickly and decisively in favor of Brown and his populist allies.",
        "Fox News stars Megyn Kelly and Sean Hannity have put a happy face on their public about Donald Trump, but their brief sniping may have once again exposed larger fissures and uncertainty at the most popular network. Kelly and Hannity tweeted a photo of themselves Thursday night that showed them arm in arm at Fox News\u2019s studios in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re Irish. It\u2019s complicated. #Friends,\u201d they both wrote. Kelly also ended her 9 p. m. program, \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d by introducing Hannity\u2019s program at 10 p. m. this way: \u201cUp next live, Sean Hannity, my friend.",
        "There\u2019s a theory that Democratic politicians seek a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally because a lot of those new citizens will vote Democratic. In September, Donald Trump embraced the idea, telling an interviewer that, if he lost, \u201cthis will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning\u201d because immigrants will flow across the border, become citizens and then vote Democratic forever. In a discussion with some border patrol agents Friday, Trump implied that some people might be skipping that middle step.",
        "Oh, the irony. After avoiding Donald Trump for months, Paul Ryan finally ready to do it: appear with the GOP presidential nominee in public, on the campaign trail, for the first time in the general election. We say \u201dwas ready,\u201d because even though there\u2019s no word of any change in his plans, he\u2019s probably feeling very unready to share a stage with Trump Saturday as planned. Their first campaign event comes less than 24 hours after The Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold published audio via a hot mic in 2005 where Trump is recorded sharing incredibly lewd things about women.",
        "The blowback to a Fox News segment this week that was chock full of Asian stereotypes has been loud and swift. Activists, Asian American organizations and journalist associations have called Jesse Watters\u2019s interviews for \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d racist and demanded explanations. Then, on Thursday night, \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d responded with the kind of angry critique of Fox News that was the hallmark of the Comedy Central show when helmed by Jon Stewart.",

        "\u201cHere is a beautiful specimen of young American childhood,\u201d Andrew Jackson declared as he examined a baby handed to him at a campaign stop in the early 1800s. It would have been the beginning of the most sacred of campaign traditions, baby kissing, except Jackson foisted the boy on a nearby politician with a directive, \u201cKiss him,\u201d and scooted away. We know, of course, why moments with children are such a part of campaigning: It\u2019s humanizing for the candidate.",
        "The Republican Party plunged into an epic and historic political crisis Saturday with just a month to go until Election Day as a growing wave of GOP lawmakers called on defiant presidential nominee Donald Trump to drop out of the race in the wake of a video showing him make crude sexual remarks.",
        "ST. LOUIS \u2014 He beamed in just after midnight Saturday like a captive in his own gilded cage. A man who demands the best of everything was speaking to America from a dimly lit, studio against a fake backdrop of the Manhattan skyline he likes to call his own. Donald Trump was a beleaguered candidate delivering conflicting messages: one of apology, insincere as it seemed to many viewers, and one of defiance. It was not clear that either message could rescue him after The Washington Post published a video Friday showing Trump making crude remarks about sexual assault.",
        "Aimee Winder Newton, a mother of four who lives in Utah, was sitting at her kitchen table when a friend, a Democrat, sent a link to the video. \u201cYour guy,\u201d was all the message said, punctuated by a emoji. \u201cMy guy?\u201d Newton thought to herself, although it was true \u2014 after much consternation and perhaps a bit of Donald Trump had become her choice for president. But as she listened to Trump describe how he could do what he wanted to women just because he was a \u201cstar,\u201d Newton decided that she had had enough.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, issued a statement on Saturday condemning comments that her husband made about women in 2005 but said she hoped that voters would accept the apology he made overnight. \u201cThe words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me,\u201d Melania Trump said in a statement circulated by the campaign. \u201cThis does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches to Wall Street banks apparently included her dreams of \u201copen trade and open borders\u201d and a suggestion that bankers are best positioned to know how the industry should be regulated, according to hacked emails made public Friday by WikiLeaks. The comments are drawn from an email describing speech transcripts that Clinton has refused to release despite months of intense criticism. The email, apparently hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, shows a staffer in the early stages of Clinton\u2019s primary campaign against Sen. Bernie Sanders this year flagging speech excerpts that could be politically problematic.",
        "CHARLESTON, S. C. \u2014 After a protracted and violent journey up the southeast U. S. seaboard, a weakened Hurricane Matthew made landfall Saturday in South Carolina, inundating a vast stretch of the coast with torrential rain and triggering floods far inland. As the tempest continued moving northeast, some towns saw as much as four inches of rain per hour. A record inches drenched Fayetteville, N. C. where the soil was already saturated from heavy September rainfall. The Cape Fear River rose quickly, and city officials reported 42 water rescues.",
        "LES CAYES, Haiti \u2014 A woman who gave birth two days before Hurricane Matthew, only to learn her husband was swept away in the flood, has spent the past week raising her newborn son on a wooden bench facing the chalkboard inside of an elementary school classroom. Down the hallway is a who attended this school but is now sleeping on its concrete floors crammed alongside more than 1, 000 people whose homes were damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Matthew.",
        "It may be no small irony that President Obama\u2019s peripatetic secretary of state will travel this week to Rwanda, where up to a million people were killed in a ethnic genocide in 1994, and has tentative plans to attend an international meeting on Syria, where civilian dead are fast approaching the halfway point of that number. Bill Clinton, president at the time of the Rwandan massacre, has said that U. S. failure to intervene there is one of his biggest regrets.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan correctly described Donald Trump\u2019s 2005 taped sexually predatory conversation as \u201csickening,\u201d but anyone interested in the health of the Republican Party should focus on the next part of Mr. Ryan\u2019s statement. The sentence that counts \u2014 the statement that reveals the amoral, abject corruption at the heart of the Republican Party in this sad season \u2014 is this: \u201cI hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.",
        "Republicans are shocked \u2014 shocked! \u2014 about Donald Trump\u2019s remarks boasting in vulgar terms about sexual assaults on women. GOP Sens. John McCain, John Thune, Kelly Ayotte, Mike Lee, Mark Kirk and Mike Crapo, two Republican governors and a dozen or more GOP members of the House either said they won\u2019t support Trump or called on Trump to quit, while many others, including Trump running mate Mike Pence, expressed their disgust. What was on the 2005 video tape, first reported by The Post\u2019s indefatigable David A.",
        "ST. LOUIS \u2014 What is truly shocking is that Donald Trump\u2019s Republican enablers are shocked. True, Trump\u2019s comments in the 2005 video made public Friday by The Post are shockingly vile, astonishingly disgusting and disgracefully open about the freedom Trump felt (because he was a \u201cstar\u201d) to grope and, let\u2019s face it, assault women. But while the investigative reporters deserve our thanks for fully exposing Trump, no one needed to rely on their work to know who he is.

        "The end of facts is nigh. Or so we have been assured by headline after headline declaring the 2016 presidential campaign the dawn of the \u201c \u201d era. This storyline resurfaced after the fractious debate Tuesday night.

The chief, his voice breaking, identified the fatally wounded officers as Jose Gilbert Vega and Lesley Zerebny. He did not disclose their rank or any other information about them. Reyes said the gunman was still at large and may still be in the home where the shooting occurred."
