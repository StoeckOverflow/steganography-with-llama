        "MOSCOW \u2014 It\u2019s kind of hard these days for Russians to get too worked up by angry statements from Washington about their leaders. What with sanctions over Crimea, tensions in Syria and in the Baltics, many here think their country is already in a slowly simmering cold war with the United States, or serves as a convenient scapegoat during a fraught election campaign. So now that the Obama administration has officially accused the Kremlin of attempting to interfere in U. S.",

What looked like a trick of the light a moment ago materializes into a trunk, branches, needles \u2014 a tree, roughly the height of a man, with delicate leaves the color of bone. It is an albino redwood, the \u201cghost\u201d of California\u2019s coastal forests. \u201cI like that metaphor a lot,\u201d biologist Zane Moore said, as he grasps a branch of the unusual conifer and holds it up to the light.",

        "If all goes according to plan, a live turkey will be tossed Saturday from a moving airplane 500 feet above the annual Turkey Trot Festival in Yellville, Ark. If history is any guide, one of three things will happen next. Option 1: The bird drops like a rock and dies on impact. Option 2: The animal awkwardly flutters to the ground, where it\u2019ll be mobbed by excited townspeople who jostle for control of the frightened animal before it\u2019s slaughtered. Option 3: The bird catches a stiff, serendipitous breeze and glides into the sunset to freedom.",

The rapport was instantaneous and we quickly escalated from messaging to texting, to making plans to meet. We even talked on the phone once or twice.
