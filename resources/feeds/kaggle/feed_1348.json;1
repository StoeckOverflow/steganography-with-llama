        "For a moment there, it looked as if \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d was going to focus its cold open last night on the debate. But it quickly got to what everyone knew was coming: Donald Trump\u2019s disaster, as first reported by The Washington Post on Friday afternoon. Alec Baldwin was back, with a Trump impression that is pretty good but also still seems like Alec Trump. He \u201c \u201d \u2014 deliberately mispronouncing \u201capologize,\u201d because Trump doesn\u2019t apologize. He quickly dismisses the Republicans who aren\u2019t defending him as \u201ccowards\u201d and \u201closers.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Anyone expecting congressional Democrats to refocus their campaigns entirely on Donald Trump\u2019s fitness for the presidency after the recent disclosure of crude remarks he made about women would have been disappointed here Saturday afternoon. Before a throng of roughly 500 devout liberals, Senate candidate Katie McGinty dutifully covered Trump\u2019s comments about his aggressive sexual advances on women, which were recorded in a 2005 video published Friday by The Washington Post. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, Donald Trump is a lewd, lecherous, lowlife,\u201d McGinty said to large applause.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 The defense got its \u201ctail whipped\u201d on the opening drive, as lineman Ziggy Hood put it, surrendering an easy touchdown less than five minutes into the game. And the offense didn\u2019t score in the first half. But on a gusty afternoon at M&T Bank Stadium, where resilience counted more than style, the Washington Redskins kept slogging away against the Baltimore Ravens to grind out a victory that won\u2019t convince anyone that they\u2019re postseason material.",
        "The Republican Party tumbled toward anarchy Monday over its presidential nominee, as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) cut Donald Trump loose in an emergency maneuver to preserve the party\u2019s endangered congressional majorities. Ryan\u2019s announcement that he would no longer defend or campaign with Trump prompted biting condemnations from within his caucus and from Trump himself, who publicly lashed out at the speaker.",
        "In Sunday night\u2019s town hall debate, Donald Trump deflected questions about his taxes by claiming that Hillary Clinton\u2019s wealthy supporters had also avoided taxes by exploiting the law. He mentioned several, including Warren Buffett, by name. Buffett responded with a statement on Monday, saying that Trump was incorrect. The octogenarian billionaire wrote that he had never taken advantage of the rule that Trump might have used to avoid paying tax on nearly $1 billion in income, according to several pages from one of his tax returns that were disclosed recently.",
        "After standing down from defending Donald Trump on the Sunday shows, with Rudy Giuliani as her replacement, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was back at it after Sunday\u2019s debate, and again on Monday morning. It didn\u2019t go that well. Conway lodged a serious accusation against unnamed Republican politicians and, at one point, sounded like she wasn\u2019t fully committed to the Trump campaign. She also otherwise seemed to fumble her messaging for Trump on the video and his debate performance.",
        "This post has been updated. Defending Donald Trump is a job. And it\u2019s thankless. But rarely does it force Republicans to take such a tortured and position as this. Trump\u2019s defenders are now quibbling with the idea that his moment \u2014 in which Trump said \u201cgrab them by the \u201d when talking about being able to do what he wanted with women \u2014 described sexual assault. This includes Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) a lawyer who was once the attorney general of Alabama and a U. S. attorney.",
        "Donald Trump preened when nominee Mike Pence got good reviews last week for his debate performance. The Donald bragged that Pence was the \u201cfirst choice\u201d he had made, and thus a praiseworthy indication of his hiring prowess. Fact check: False. Trump made a much more telling choice two months earlier \u2014 a hiring decision that was appallingly evident before, during and after the presidential debate Sunday night. In picking Stephen K.",
        "AMBRIDGE, Pa. \u2014 Donald Trump continued to attack Hillary Clinton over her husband\u2019s marital indiscretions during a campaign event here Monday, citing allegations of sexual improprieties against former president Bill Clinton while dismissing intense criticism over his own treatment of women. \u201cAs I outlined last night, Bill Clinton was the worst abuser of women ever to sit in the Oval Office. He was a sexual predator,\u201d Trump said.",
        "LUMBERTON, N. C. \u2014 Residents in areas southwest of Raleigh were urged Tuesday to seek higher ground amid warnings of flash floods and fears that a major dam could rupture from water levels swollen by Hurricane Matthew. \u201cMove to higher ground now,\u201d said a report issued by the National Weather Service. warnings remained in effect in Moore County, about 50 miles southwest of Raleigh and near Fort Bragg.",
        "There seems to be no way for the international community to stop the ongoing war crimes being committed by the Syrian regime and its Russian allies, especially in Aleppo. But by brazenly flouting international law, leaders and officials in both countries are opening themselves up to future justice in multiple ways. Secretary of State John F. Kerry issued a surprising call Friday for investigations into the atrocities. \u201cRussia and the regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals, medical facilities, children, women,\u201d Kerry said.",
        "Over the weekend, Donald Trump did what he always does when things go south for him. He walked away. He announced he is not the man at 70 he had been at 59 when he had boasted of sexual assault, and he pledged \u201cto be a better man tomorrow. \u201d With that, he effectively declared moral bankruptcy, paying about a dime on the dollar of sincerity. It was, of course, what Trump had done six times in business, only this time the crisis was not about his finances, but his character. He had been caught talking trash about women.",
        "ON FRIDAY, while much of the country was preoccupied with the latest revelations about Donald Trump, the U. S. intelligence community made an alarming and unprecedented announcement: Russia was seeking \u201cto interfere with the U. S. election process\u201d through the hacking of political organizations and individuals, including the Democratic National Committee. The statement rightly alarmed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who said in Sunday night\u2019s debate that \u201cwe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. \u201d And Mr.",
        "New Iberia, La. For an illustration of how cruel the country\u2019s latest wave of nativism has grown, look to Louisiana. Here, a new state law has effectively made it illegal for thousands of refugees to get married. It all started last year. Having lost the fight over gay marriage, the state\u2019s religious right decided that the sacred institution of wedlock was once again under attack \u2014 this time, by devious immigrants. Undocumented workers and even terrorists had newly discovered they could exploit Louisiana\u2019s marriage laws to gain citizenship, legislators claimed, leading to a supposed epidemic of \u201cmarriage fraud.",
        "On the debate stage Sunday night, we saw a lifelong public servant with total grasp of the issues and concrete plans to take the nation forward. And we saw a fraudulent boor who knows nothing about anything and brags about groping women. Let\u2019s not pretend anymore that we have an actual choice. Let\u2019s not pretend there is any question about who \u201cwon\u201d the debate, because only one candidate \u2014 Hillary Clinton \u2014 actually debated.",
        "THE CLINTON campaign has refused to deny or confirm the authenticity of a WikiLeaks report including apparent purloined emailed excerpts of her paid speeches to corporate audiences in the years between her departure from the State Department in 2013 and her declaration for president in 2015. We hope the excerpts are genuine, because at least in the texts made public as of Monday, the Hillary Clinton that emerges is a knowledgeable, balanced political veteran with sound policy instincts and a mature sense of how to sustain a decent, stable democracy. With a level of unimaginable in her opponent, Ms.",
        "A U. S. Navy destroyer off the coast of Yemen came under attack Sunday night in the Red Sea, with two missiles fired at it in the same region where an vessel was badly damaged by rocket fire last week. The USS Mason was not hit in the attack, said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. The incident occurred about 7 p. m. as the ship, deployed from Norfolk, Va. was in international waters. Both missiles splashed down in the water before reaching the Mason, he said.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 It was just after noon when police stormed the local television station and cut the feed as employees \u2014 stunned but defiant \u2014 looked on. \u201cThe truth cannot be silenced!\u201d the reporters chanted as authorities charged through the studio. The channel, aligned with the Kurdish opposition, was one of dozens of outlets closed last week as Turkey expanded a crackdown that began after a failed coup in July. Thousands of soldiers, bureaucrats, professors and doctors have been suspended or detained since the attempted revolt, which the government blames on an Islamic preacher exiled in the United States.",
        "Many scientists have predicted that climate change could cause wildfires to increase in the future. And a new study, just out on Monday, demonstrates just how much it\u2019s already been making them worse. The paper, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the effects of climate change have been helping make forests in the western United States \u2014 in states including New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and everything else to the west \u2014 drier and easier to burn since the 1970s.",
        "The \u201cToday\u201d show had no choice on Monday morning \u2014 it had to address the suspension of Billy Bush, the show\u2019s 9 a. m. . On Friday, The Washington Post published a 2005 video of Donald Trump making extremely lewd comments about women, all while on a bus with Bush to film a segment on \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d where Bush was a at the time. Bush, who can be heard laughing and joking with Trump during the exchange, faced massive criticism from viewers.",
        "Following the latest, looniest developments in the presidential campaign on television over the last few days, it was easy to see a nation falling apart. Or maybe, just maybe, it was finally coming to its senses. \u201cBREAKING NEWS,\u201d that dreaded appellation, lived up to its billing for the first time in this 2016 election.",
        "Donald Trump appeared to throw his running mate under the bus during Sunday night\u2019s debate, flatly disowning Mike Pence\u2019s policy on a major foreign policy issue \u2014 Syria. \u201dHe and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree,\u201d Trump said. \u201dI disagree.\u201d It was a striking moment of discord for a presidential ticket just four weeks before an election. But Pence now says it\u2019s much ado about nothing. Pence told CNN on Monday morning that he wasn\u2019t thrown under the bus because it was all just one big misunderstanding.",
        "This post has been updated with Breitbart\u2019s response and Broaddrick\u2019s reversal. Seated next to Donald Trump at a campaign event Sunday night, Juanita Broaddrick repeated her charge that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978 \u2014 an accusation she has contradicted under oath and which the former president denies. Then, after the debate \u2014 which she attended \u2014 Broaddrick made another claim that quickly raised eyebrows among reporters and campaign finance experts. Broaddrick told me in spin room Breitbart paid for her flight out here https: .",
        "For months, filmmaker Nate Parker and his historical drama \u2018The Birth of a Nation\u2019 have dominated headlines. First came the soaring expectations for his indie film, branded a surefire Oscar favorite at Sundance and snapped up by Fox Searchlight for a record $17. 5 million. Then came the scandal surrounding a 17 rape case involving Parker and his . But after the movie\u2019s mediocre debut in theaters this past weekend, it\u2019s safe to say the big buzz around \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d is probably over. The film earned a disappointing $7.",
        "If you are among those shopping for your own personal White House, don\u2019t worry. You have options. Is the replica White House for sale on Georgetown Pike in McLean \u2014 complete with curved portico and towering columns \u2014 not quite right? Then maybe the replica White House for sale two miles away on Towlston Road is more to your taste in bootleg executive mansions. That one comes with a Truman balcony. And, priced at $2.",
        "As he rode the subway to work, Richard Brookshire couldn\u2019t stop seething over the letter he found taped to his door. A friend had called at 1 a. m. Thursday, looking for advice on quitting his job. Brookshire, a manager at a leadership institute who writes on the side, paced around his Manhattan apartment for a giving the friend advice on the right tone to strike in the resignation letter, then crawled into bed.",
        "Timberlake, 22, from Shanxi province, is a student at Beijing International Studies University. He identifies as asexual and loves to dance in high heels. His special place is this large corridor inside one of the buildings on campus. He likes to practice dancing here. (Teo Butturini) Despite being decriminalized in 1997, homosexuality is still heavily stigmatized in China.

        "Donald Trump declared war on the Republican establishment Tuesday, lashing out at House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) and other GOP elected officials as the extraordinary turbulence within the Republican Party intensified four weeks from Election Day. One day after Ryan said he would no longer campaign on Trump\u2019s behalf, the GOP nominee said as part of a barrage of tweets that Ryan is \u201cweak and ineffective\u201d and has provided \u201czero support\u201d for his candidacy.",
        "Tuesday marks four weeks until the 2016 election. And the Republican presidential nominee is in the midst of blowing up his own party.

It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to. \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Donald Trump has called for historic tax relief for the rich, which would likely add trillions of dollars to the national debt. Hillary Clinton would ask the wealthy to pay much more than they do now, and she would use the money mostly to lessen the burden on families with small children. A pair of new analyses published Tuesday afternoon by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center emphasize the extreme contrasts between the two candidates when it comes to taxes."
