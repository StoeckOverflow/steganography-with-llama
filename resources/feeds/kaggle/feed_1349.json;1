        "RED BANKS, N. C. \u2014 During her first night of homelessness, Phyllis Heywood retreated to the far corner of a windowless high school gym and slept on the hardwood floor. The noise of several hundred others woke her up after just a few hours, and so Heywood walked into a bathroom stall, hung her clothing on a hook and bathed herself with a soapy rag. She rinsed with two bottles of water. \u201cI\u2019m just desperate for some privacy,\u201d said Heywood, 59, who\u2019d left her apartment a day earlier by boat.",
        "This was the week the man Changed his mind about mass deportation. There will not be a total ban Of Muslims, only extreme filtration. And the week the nominee was unhorsed By a revelatory video that hit And the New York Times was forced To print words that were not fit. He was 59 and talking about his great luck Here are key moments from the fiery style presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 9.",
        "SEOUL Watching Donald Trump skulking behind Hillary Clinton on the debate stage Sunday night, muttering about locking her up if he wins, was a reminder that we are drifting toward a kind of where power is everything. You see this coarsening climate of relations around the globe, in the debasement of the norms that make civilized life possible.",
        "It should surprise no one that this presidential election \u2014 the first ever to involve a female nominee from a major party in the top spot \u2014 has devolved into a contest of man\u2019s ultimate metaphor. I\u2019m not referring to a spitting competition, if you\u2019re struggling here. Rather, the race apparently is to determine who is the worst man on the stage \u2014 Bill Clinton or Donald Trump. Never mind that Hillary Clinton is the one running for president.",
        "Donald Trump is right about one thing. The European members of the NATO alliance have long taken it for granted that the United States would always be their security umbrella. Because of this, the Europeans, with few exceptions, have ignored repeated calls by successive U. S. administrations to share more of the burden for their collective security and defense. That said, the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s idea that the United States should wash its hands of NATO horrifies the Pentagon, the State Department and America\u2019s European allies. Without America, NATO would become toothless.",
        "WITH DONALD Trump\u2019s polling numbers in a tailspin, he has doubled down in calling on Republican vigilantes to take matters into their own hands to thwart what many of them are primed to regard, without proof, as a rigged election. The Republican nominee\u2019s rhetoric, inciting white rural and suburban voters who fear the voting clout of black urban Democrats, is a recipe for voter intimidation and even violence on Election Day. It also lays the groundwork for his followers to believe, if he loses, that his defeat was a historic swindle. Starting in August, and accelerating this month, Mr.",
        "For the 10th episode of \u201cCape Up,\u201d we\u2019re doing something different. We\u2019re talking art with one of the stars of contemporary art, P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami (PAMM) director Franklin Sirmans. And what he\u2019s doing at his stunning outpost on Biscayne Bay made for a fascinating conversation. \u201cSure, there are people who would say museums aren\u2019t for me. It\u2019s this place that is of the past. But I \u2026 really believe we are different,\u201d Sirmans told me. \u201cWhat you have is, you have the opportunity to create a museum, a real museum.",
        "Samsung said Tuesday that it would discontinue production of its smartphone, an unprecedented move for the company and one that could reorder the global market for mobile devices. The Galaxy Note 7 was supposed to be the crown jewel of the smartphone lineup for Samsung, which once garnered little respect in the clubby world of Silicon Valley but is now the primary rival to Apple. Samsung\u2019s ascendancy has been celebrated by those who wanted a alternative to the iPhone and held up in Korea as evidence of the country\u2019s arrival as tech power.",
        "GREENSBORO, N. C. \u2014 One of the jobs of the leader of the free world is to shake hands with the public. A lot of hands. For President Obama, that means taking additional precautions \u2014 and we don\u2019t mean by using a lot of disinfectant afterward. The video above shows the president approaching a rope line at the airport here in Greensboro, where he is spending Tuesday at a town event on race and a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton.",
        "Donald Trump is a man on his heels. And as both voters and members of his own party start to desert him, he\u2019s increasingly prone to lash out. He has now suggested that he would put Hillary Clinton in jail as president and is going after Bill Clinton\u2019s indiscretions as hard as ever, following a Washington Post report of a 2005 video in which he made extremely lewd and sexually aggressive comments about women.",
        "\u201cI am also here to support Trump. At 12 years old, Hillary put me through something that you would never put a through. And she says she is for women and children. \u201d \u2014 Kathy Shelton, at a news conference hosted by Donald Trump, Oct. 9, 2016 \u201cHillary then began to attack my character, forcing me to undergo multiple polygraph tests where I was asked explicit sexual questions I didn\u2019t even understand. Next I was sent for a psychiatric examination. It felt like I was the one on trial.",
        "Less that two hours after",
        "Hillary Clinton defended some of her comments to the business community in Sunday night\u2019s debate by invoking Abraham Lincoln. Donald Trump\u2019s retort was one of his better lines of the night: \u201dNow she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. Now that one, I haven\u2019t . .. Okay? Honest Abe.\u201d It was such a good line, in fact, that the Republican presidential nominee was still using it Monday while campaigning in Pennsylvania. It was a good move on Trump\u2019s part for two reasons.",
        "A federal appeals court dealt a blow to the government\u2019s consumer watchdog Tuesday by ruling that the structure of the agency is unconstitutional. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found that the setup of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is led by a single director, is not in line with other independent agencies, which are typically run by a group of commissioners. The decision was a response to a petition from mortgage lender PHH, which challenged an enforcement action from the agency and called for the CFPB to be eliminated.",
        "Comcast is paying one of the biggest fines ever levied on a cable company after regulators said it illegally billed customers for unwanted equipment and services. In a settlement with the Federal Communications Commission, Comcast is agreeing to pay $2. 3 million. It\u2019s also agreeing to give consumers a chance to block the addition of new services and equipment if they don\u2019t want it. Some subscribers who complained to the FCC said they\u2019d been charged for premium channels, boxes or video recording devices despite telling the company they weren\u2019t looking for upgrades, the agency said Tuesday.",
        "A powerful surveillance program that police used for tracking racially charged protests in Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo. relied on special feeds of user data provided by Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, according to an ACLU blog post published Tuesday. The companies reportedly provided the data \u2014 often including the locations of users \u2014 to Geofeedia, a company that says it analyzes social media posts to deliver surveillance information to 500 law enforcement agencies.",
        "Out beyond Neptune, past Pluto, through the chaos of the Kuiper belt to a point some 8. 5 billion miles from the sun, a new dwarf planet has just joined our solar system. The object, which is about half as big as Pluto and twice as distant, was described Tuesday in the International Astronomical Union\u2019s Minor Planet Electronic Circulator. It joins a growing list of dwarf planets known to populate the solar system: Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, Eris and \u2014 most famous of all \u2014 Pluto. It\u2019s suspected there could be at least 100 more.",
        "The first 911 call came at 11:43 p. m. Saturday, a report from a concerned motorist about a Toyota truck barreling down Interstate 89 on the wrong side of the road. More calls followed. Vermont state and local police dispatched cruisers, hoping to intercept the erratic driver, to stop the truck before a crash did. They drove alongside motorists who couldn\u2019t possibly know the danger speeding toward them and carloads of people they had no way of warning. Among them was a Volkswagen Jetta carrying five teenagers barely old enough to drive. Nine minutes later, at 11:53 p. m.",
        "WikiLeaks released yet another batch of hacked emails from inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign Wednesday, and with them came another round of embarrassing headlines and new glimpses of internal anxiety over the candidate\u2019s weaknesses. Republican Donald Trump and his allies seized on the emails, which reveal comments by an aide about Catholics, a line from a paid speech in which Clinton might be seen as playing down the threat of terrorism and an internal dispute over potential conflicts of interest posed by the Clinton Foundation. The of damaging attention is likely to continue.",
        "Donald Trump waged a fight against both the Republican establishment and Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, while the Democratic nominee denounced \u201cscorched earth\u201d tactics by Republicans. Speaking at an afternoon rally in Ocala, Fla. Trump continued his verbal assault against House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) who said Monday that he would no longer campaign with Trump or defend him. The GOP nominee bragged about his performance in Sunday\u2019s debate and voiced disappointment that Ryan\u2019s reaction to it wasn\u2019t warmer. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you think that Paul Ryan would call and say, \u2018Good going\u2019?\u201d Trump asked the crowd.",
        "This post has been updated Three women accused Donald Trump of groping or kissing them without their consent in news reports published Wednesday, just days after the Republican presidential nominee insisted in a debate that he had never engaged in such behavior. One of the women alleges that Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt during a flight more than three decades ago, the New York Times reported. The other says he kissed her on the mouth outside an elevator in 2005, according to the same report.",
        "Prison inmates, a remarkably ingenious bunch, are disrupting methods of smuggling drugs, porn and cellphones the same way online retailers hope to one day deliver socks and underwear to American homes \u2014 through the air, with drones. By coordinating with wingmen on the outside for shipments of contraband, inmates can bypass the need to bribe corrupt guards or persuade family members to hide forbidden items in body cavities. Though nobody is precisely sure just how many drones are landing every day in prisons, the threat is global.",
        "Wells Fargo announced Wednesday that its longtime chief executive and chairman, John G. Stumpf, is stepping down, the latest turn for the embattled megabank after it admitted that thousands of employees had set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas. Stumpf\u2019s sudden downfall is likely to send shivers through Wall Street where a playbook for surviving public scandals appears to have been torn to pieces, upended by the type of populist anger that has fueled the rise of Republican Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D) on this year\u2019s presidential campaign trail.",
        "What is the Republican Party? Suddenly, this has become one of the central questions of the 2016 campaign. It\u2019s not simply a matter of whether the GOP is the party of Donald Trump or the party of Paul D. Ryan. It is also an issue of whether Republican congressional leaders have any connection with the seething grass roots whose anger they stoked during the Obama years but always hoped to contain. Trump is the product of their colossal miscalculations.",
        "Of all the in the WikiLeaks release of hacked emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign, none was less revelatory than the predictable fact that she had preached the gospel of limited disclosure, behind closed doors. \u201cIf everybody\u2019s watching, you know, all of the backroom discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least,\u201d she told the National Multifamily Housing Council in 2013, apropos the legislative sausage factory. \u201cSo you need both a public and a private position.",
        "Donald Trump has discovered Haiti. The Republican presidential nominee has jumped on revelations that Bill and Hillary Clinton played favorites in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake that took the lives of 200, 000 Haitians and left 1. 5 million homeless. ABC News reported that \u201cfriends of Bill\u201d and \u201cWJC VIPs\u201d got special access in the scramble for lucrative reconstruction contracts in the country. On a tour of southern Florida this week, Trump praised the efforts of Haitian immigrants and their contributions to the United States and blasted the Clintons\u2019 favoritism.",
        "DURING HIS first presidential debate against Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump congratulated himself on his restraint in not bringing up the sexual behavior of Bill Clinton. \u201cInappropriate . . . not nice\u201d was his explanation of why \u201cI just can\u2019t do it. \u201d But any vestige of nicety evaporated when the lewd video of Mr. Trump boasting about the sexual assault of women surfaced. Since Sunday\u2019s second debate, Mr. Trump has placed at the center of his campaign women who have accused Mr. Clinton of sexual improprieties, while charging Ms. Clinton with \u201cviciously\u201d attacking women.",
        "John R. Kasich, a Republican, is governor of Ohio. Does the United States still have the ability \u2014 or the will \u2014 to be the undisputed global leader, a role it has held since World War II? It\u2019s a question to be answered soon by members of Congress as they approve or reject an initiative to give the United States expanded access to 11 countries that represent more than a quarter of the world\u2019s trade, while leveling the playing field for U. S. workers and businesses.",
        "Anwar Ibrahim is founder of the People\u2019s Justice Party and a former deputy prime minister of Malaysia. Sungai Buloh Prison, Malaysia \u2014 Yesterday, Malaysia\u2019s Federal Court heard my final appeal to reverse the injustice of my detention at the hands of the Malaysian government. It won\u2019t likely issue a final decision on my case for many months. What is really at stake in Malaysia, however, is a catastrophic slide to authoritarian kleptocracy by a country that was set to be the shining example of pluralistic democracy in a Muslim majority country.",
        "Keith Lamont Scott was struck at least three times by bullets fired by a police officer, with at least one of the fatal shots striking him in the back, according to a private autopsy conducted for his family and obtained by The Washington Post. The autopsy, performed on Sept. 30, concluded that Scott, 43, was struck in his upper back, abdomen, and near his left hand \u2014 a shot that had both entrance and exit wounds."
