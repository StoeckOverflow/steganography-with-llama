        "The financial cornerstone of the NFL as it has grown into the nation\u2019s most prosperous and popular sports league has been its network television deals. Pro football has been TV ratings gold, and the league\u2019s handsome reward for that has been contracts with the networks now collectively worth an estimated $7 billion annually. So when ratings for NFL games slip, even while remaining at comparatively lofty levels, it is noteworthy. Such is the case this season, with the sport\u2019s overall TV ratings down about 11 percent from last season. The average NFL game had drawn 16.",
        "The footprints weave intricate paths across the desolate landscape. Some tracks race straight toward an unseen finish line; others meander, the outlines of their ancient owners\u2019 toes and curves of their arches carved deeply into the earth. The air shimmers with heat, and the active volcano that locals call \u201dthe mountain of God\u201d looms in the middle distance. It\u2019s not difficult for geologist Cynthia to imagine this scene as it would have looked thousands of years ago, when prehistoric people walked across the muddy terrain and left an indelible record of their presence pressed into the ground.",
        "For now, McDonald\u2019s is benching its mascot. In a statement Tuesday, the chain announced that Ronald McDonald and his signature red and gold garb won\u2019t be seen in public for a while, at least until America stops being so collectively terrified of his kind. The chain\u2019s more than 14, 000 locations nationwide are \u201cmindful of the current climate around clown sightings in communities\u201d and \u201care being thoughtful in respect to Ronald McDonald\u2019s participation in community events for the time being,\u201d spokeswoman Terri Hickey said in an emailed statement to NBC News. https: .",
        "The United States is awash in pork, beef, eggs, milk and bountiful harvests. U. S. meat companies are producing nearly 5 percent more beef than in 2015, thanks in part to plentiful feed supplies. In turn, the big food producers like Cargill, are seeing profits rise. The Minnesota conglomerate recently reported a 66 percent jump in profits because of demand for its steaks and hamburgers. And yet the boom in supply is driving down prices at the grocery store, pinching retailer profits. The pressure may build with this week\u2019s news that online retailer Amazon.",
        "Many white people fought alongside African Americans in the civil rights movement. But few made as vital and enduring an impact as Jack Greenberg, a protege of and successor to Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Mr. Greenberg, who died Oct. 12 at 91, joined the New legal organization in 1949, fresh out of Columbia Law School. At the time, civil rights law was a small field frequently overlooked by ambitious white lawyers, but Mr. Greenberg said he was invigorated by the principles at stake and the intellectual challenge on hand.",
        "Watching Donald Trump talk during a presidential debate about jailing his opponent was a jarring experience for Al Cardenas, who traces his Republican identity in part to his hatred of the authoritarian Castro regime he fled more than a ago. \u201cAs a refugee from a dictatorship, that attitude sounds all too familiar,\u201d said Cardenas, former chairman of the Florida Republican Party and of the American Conservative Union. For John Yoo, the conservative legal scholar and former Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, Trump \u201creminds me a lot of early Mussolini. \u2026 very disturbingly similar.",
        "It was October 1998, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s midterm campaign swing for Democratic candidates brought the first lady on a Saturday afternoon to a gymnasium in Janesville, Wis. A conservative upstart from the town was running for Congress \u2014 and Clinton, rallying 1, 200 people with a denunciation of Republicans, was trying to stop him. Clinton\u2019s efforts failed, of course. Paul D. Ryan went on to win, and he has held his House seat in Wisconsin\u2019s industrial southeastern corner for nearly two decades as he has risen to become the Republican in the country.",
        "The hunt for the tapes is on. In the wake of a leak last week of a tape in which Donald Trump is heard making crude and predatory comments about women in 2005, the question is: Are there more? Because Trump has lived much of his adult life in front of cameras and microphones, the answer is undoubtedly yes. Whether there are more that are as shocking and potentially as the outtakes from the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video of 11 years ago, however, remains to be seen.",
        "Perched in the upper altitudes of Raymah province are villages, houses of stone that stud a series of mountains. Though these people are largely sheltered from the raging Yemen war, the remote lifestyle creates basic survival challenges. The people live without electricity or running water, according to Reuters photographer Abduljabbar Zeyad, who visited the area in May and June. Residents must travel long distances to see a doctor. To move goods, they have three choices: by foot, by donkey, or by a rickety, rusted cable car powered by an automobile engine.",
        "Two speeches. Two Americas. A pair of apocalyptic arguments and one call to burn down the house. That\u2019s the summation from just two remarkable hours Thursday that crystallized the final month of Campaign 2016. In appearances, in what might be the two most compelling hours of the entire election, Michelle Obama in New Hampshire and Donald Trump in Florida delivered the fiercest, most provocative and speeches of an election cycle that has been without precedent in hot rhetoric. The presidential campaign has been building toward all this.",
        "In early 2006, Natasha Stoynoff, a writer for People magazine, a flowery account of Donald Trump\u2019s marriage to his third wife, Melania. \u201cThere\u2019s my baby!\u201d the story quotes Trump as saying while he rushes toward his wife. \u201cThen he corrects himself. \u2018I mean . . . there are my babies! \u2019\u201d The story doesn\u2019t mention what Stoynoff alleged Wednesday night in a account posted by the magazine: That in the course of interviewing Trump for the story at his Florida estate, he pinned her up against a wall and forced himself on her.",
        "Waves of aides and surrogates have fanned out in recent days to defend Donald Trump after the release of a video in which he brags about forcing himself on women and subsequent allegations that he groped or kissed multiple women without their consent. But in trying to justify or dismiss the reports, many of Trump\u2019s defenders only seem to be making the situation worse.",
        "A threatened lawsuit by Donald Trump against the New York Times for its article about two women who said he subjected them to unwanted sexual advances would face almost insurmountable odds and very likely fail, legal experts say. But they added that Trump\u2019s vow to sue the newspaper for its story might have a more immediate effect: It could serve as a warning shot to other women who are considering making similar allegations against the Republican presidential candidate.",
        "Every night, they had the same routine. The Georgetown University business student would settle in for his cram session \u2014 soda, chips, books lined up. And the janitor would come in to start his night shift \u2014 polishing each of the windows in the study room, moving amid all those books and chips and sodas. Invisible. \u201cThere was this space, like ice separating us,\u201d said Oneil Batchelor, an immigrant from Jamaica.",
        "Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday for work that the Swedish Academy described as \u201chaving created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition. \u201d He is the first American to win the prize since Toni Morrison in 1993, and a groundbreaking choice by the Nobel committee to select the first literature laureate whose career has primarily been as a musician. Although long rumored as a contender for the prize, Dylan was far down the list of predicted winners, which included such renown writers as Haruki Murakami and Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o.",
        "The second presidential debate \u2014 bloody, muddy and raucous \u2014 was just enough to save Donald Trump\u2019s campaign from extinction, but not enough to restore his chances of winning, barring an act of God (a medical calamity) or of Putin (a cosmically incriminating WikiLeak). That Trump crashed because of a tape is odd. It should have been a surprise to no one. His views on women have been on open display for years. And he\u2019d offered a dazzling array of other reasons for disqualification: habitual mendacity, pathological narcissism, profound ignorance and an astonishing dearth of basic human empathy.",
        "Let\u2019s begin with the People magazine writer who says that Donald Trump took her into a room at his estate \u2014 while his pregnant wife was changing her clothes upstairs \u2014 and \u201cwithin seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat. \u201d Natasha Stoynoff is an experienced journalist with multiple books to her credit, and her story is similar to those told by others. A second woman told the Palm Beach Post that she, too, was groped by Trump at the Florida estate.",
        "In the interest of fairness, I wish to raise an issue on which Donald Trump has been consistently and resoundingly right: The Republican Party is utterly pathetic. During a decade of commentary, and in a career of government service before that, I have often argued that the GOP is better than its liberal stereotypes. It is a case I can no longer make, at least when it comes to presidential politics.",
        "SEOUL When South Korean officials talk about the growing nuclear challenge from North Korea, they use phrases such as \u201cexistential threat,\u201d \u201cimminent danger\u201d and \u201cdagger at the throat. \u201d They want Americans to understand that this story of brinkmanship has entered a new phase. One senior South Korean official told me starkly: \u201cA nuclear missile from the North can land on this office in four to five minutes. We don\u2019t have the luxury of thinking twice. . . . This is no longer a dark cloud on the horizon. It\u2019s a threat at our doorstep.",
        "Everybody knows the Affordable Care Act has been a massive, expensive failure, with prices and spending spiraling out of control. We heard this on Wednesday, from Minnesota\u2019s Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton: \u201cThe reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. \u201d And earlier this month from Bill Clinton, who characterized Obamacare price hikes as \u201cthe craziest thing in the world. \u201d And of course from Donald Trump, in the second presidential debate: \u201cObamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide.",
        "The FBI will launch a pilot project early next year to begin collecting statistics nationwide and create the first online national database on both deadly and nonfatal interactions the public has with law enforcement. \u201cAccurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about relations,\u201d said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch in a statement Thursday. \u201cThe initiatives we are announcing today are vital efforts toward increasing transparency and building trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve.",
        "Verizon on Thursday signaled that Yahoo\u2019s massive data breach disclosed three weeks ago was a significant event that could halt the telecom giant\u2019s $4. 8 billion purchase of the tech firm\u2019s core business. \u201cI think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material,\u201d Verizon General Counsel Craig Silliman said of the breach, speaking to a small group of reporters at a roundtable. A \u201cmaterial\u201d effect in this case is one that would harm Yahoo\u2019s financial value, and make the Web giant less attractive to purchase.",
        "More than half a million patients who had surgery in the United States in the past several years could be at risk for a deadly bacterial infection linked to a device used during their operations, federal health officials said Thursday. Although rare, such infections may cause serious illness or death. The infection is particularly insidious because it is difficult to detect. Patients may not develop symptoms or signs for months after initial exposure. In just the past year, at least 28 cases have been identified, with hospitals in Iowa, Michigan and Pennsylvania reporting infections.",
        "The warming was almost instantaneous. In the blink of an eye, geologically speaking, thousands of gigatons of carbon were released into the atmosphere. The global temperature rose by as many as 8 degrees Celsius. The oceans became more acidic. Sea levels surged upward. Hundreds of species went extinct. Sound familiar? These events actually happened 55. 6 million years ago, during a period of dramatic global warming called the Thermal Maximum (PETM).",
        "Michelle Obama ditched her campaign speech at a rally for Hillary Clinton today in Manchester, N. H. to discuss the language Donald Trump has used to describe women and the accusations of sexual assault he is facing. \u201cTo dismiss this as talk is an insult to decent men everywhere,\u201d she said, referring to comments Trump made during a 2005 taping of \u201cAccess Hollywood. \u201d Keeping with her tack of not addressing Trump by name, she said, \u201cWe have a candidate for president of the United States that has said things about women that are so shocking, so demeaning.",
        "Donald Trump has been battling intense backlash over admissions he made during a faux pas in 2005, when he told television host Billy Bush that he had kissed and groped women without their consent. The Republican presidential candidate dismissed the recorded conversation as \u201d talk.\u201d \u201dYou described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals,\u201d CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper told Trump on Sunday night during the second presidential debate. \u201dThat is sexual assault.\u201d Cooper added: \u201dYou bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?\u201d \u201dNo, I didn\u2019t say that at all,\u201d Trump replied.",
        "The Washington Post asked the two major presidential candidates \u2014 Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump \u2014 to respond to an identical series of questions about their vision and plans for public schools should they become president of the United States. Public education is one of the most important issues the country faces, but there has been little discussion about it during this campaign cycle. The Post\u2019s education team asked questions about a number of topics, including school funding, school choice, standardized testing, education and the Common Core State Standards.",
        "King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, the world\u2019s monarch, a strong U. S. ally and a national unity symbol who acted as tiebreaker during confrontations between his country\u2019s military leaders and democracy advocates, died Oct. 13 in Bangkok. He was 88. The king had long suffered from lung infections, liver problems and other medical issues. Thailand\u2019s royal palace announced the death but gave no specific health reason. His frail health was closely watched in a country marked by frequent coup attempts and changes of prime minister, and his death was expected to plunge the national into further distress.",
        "D. C. restaurants may be good enough to catch the eye of the Michelin Guide, but its inspectors didn\u2019t find any quite good enough to merit its top rating of three stars. The company released its Washington guide today, potentially elevating the 12 restaurants that received its coveted stars into international renown. Though no restaurant was awarded three stars, three restaurants \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\u2018 Minibar, Aaron Silverman\u2019s Pineapple and Pearls, and Patrick O\u2019Connell\u2019s The Inn at Little Washington \u2014 received two stars. People of America+the World, Gentes de Espa\u00f1a! Got phone call!",
        "\u201cIt is easy to remember the exact place and date my journey turned toward becoming set photographer of \u201cThe Birth of a Nation. \u201d It was on a sweltering rooftop of an auto mechanic\u2019s garage in St. Louis, Missouri. Aug. 25, 2014, the day teenager Mike Brown was buried, 16 days after he was gunned down in the street by a Ferguson police officer,\u201d wrote Washington Post photographer Jahi Chikwendiu in recent piece for the Sunday Arts and Style section. It was there in St. Louis that he met actor and director Nate Parker."
