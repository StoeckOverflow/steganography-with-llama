        "GREENSBORO, N. C. \u2014 Donald Trump suggested several times Friday that he would not have sexually harassed the women who have accused him of assault because of their physical attractiveness. The comments, which appeared to be made offhandedly, drew repeated laughs from the audience. \u201cBelieve me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you,\u201d Trump said during a campaign event here, referring to one alleged victim. \u201cYou don\u2019t know. That would not be my first choice.",
        "A former contestant on the reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d on Friday accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of aggressively kissing her and groping her breasts during a 2007 meeting to discuss a possible job at the Trump Organization. Summer Zervos, who appeared on the show in 2006 and now owns a California restaurant, spoke about the incident at a news conference alongside civil rights lawyer Gloria Allred. At times tearing up, Zervos said the incident occurred at Trump\u2019s bungalow hotel suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel, which she visited after he suggested the two have dinner.",
        "Kristin Anderson was deep in conversation with acquaintances at a crowded Manhattan nightspot and did not notice the figure to her right on a red velvet couch \u2014 until, she recalls, his fingers slid under her miniskirt, moved up her inner thigh and touched her vagina through her underwear. Anderson shoved the hand away, fled the couch and turned to take her first good look at the man who had touched her, she said. She recognized him as Donald Trump: \u201cHe was so distinctive looking \u2014 with the hair and the eyebrows. I mean, nobody else has those eyebrows.",
        "In the hours after People magazine correspondent Natasha Stoynoff said she had been sexually assaulted in 2005 by Donald Trump, while she was interviewing him about his wedding anniversary at his estate, I had the chance to wonder what I, as the magazine\u2019s editor, would have done had she told me about Trump\u2019s predation. For a second there, I imagined a scene of Ben outrage, calling out the swine for his behavior and striking a blow for reporters everywhere. But in reality, I would probably have simply killed the story that Stoynoff had gone to Palm Beach to report.",
        "GREENSBORO, N. C. \u2014 More than 250, 000 people in North Carolina are losing the health plans they bought under the Affordable Care Act because two of the three insurers are dropping out \u2014 a stark example of the disruption roiling marketplaces in many parts of the country. The defections mean that almost all of the state, from the Blue Ridge to the Outer Banks, will have just one insurer selling ACA policies when the exchanges open again for business in November. The remaining company, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, agonized over whether to leave, too.",
        "Football, America\u2019s biggest powerhouse, has been thrust into a crisis this fall, with dwindling ratings sparking questions over whether it can remain a gold mine for television in an age when more Americans are abandoning traditional TV. Network executives have long used the National Football League\u2019s live games as a last line of defense against the rapid growth of \u201c \u201d and viewing upending the industry.",
        "The arm went around my shoulder. Then the hand began to creep, farther and farther, down the neckline of my dress. I was 20, at a fancy dinner for my college newspaper. The hand belonged to a \u2014 make that supposedly \u2014 editor. An editor from whom I wanted a summer job. I would like to tell you that I removed said hand and told its owner in no uncertain terms what he could do with it or, more to the point, couldn\u2019t. But I can\u2019t.",
        "Welcome to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and the third \u201cUnseemly Clash of the Candidates\u201d brought to you by the Commission on Presidential Debates. This final contest comes on the heels of two equally ugly and disgusting performances, on Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N. Y. and on Sunday at Washington University in St. Louis. Tonight, the two contenders come together for the final time, something many Americans will undoubtedly greet with gratitude. Now let\u2019s introduce the candidates. In the blue corner is the Democratic nominee from Chappaqua, N. Y.",
        "Another small step was taken last week on the steep and winding ascent back to constitutional norms. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, the nation\u2019s important court, did its judicial duty by reprimanding Congress for abandoning constitutional propriety. The court declared unconstitutional the unprecedented independence that Congress had conferred on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This legal skirmish about one aspect of this one tentacle of the administrative state may seem recondite and trivial. It concerns, however, two momentous matters. One is the integrity of the federal government\u2019s Madisonian architecture.",
        "Nathaniel Persily is a professor at Stanford Law School. Jon Cohen is chief research officer for SurveyMonkey. If there had been any doubt, it has now become clear that this election campaign is about more than the selection of a president: The values that support American democracy are deteriorating. Large numbers of Americans across party lines have lost faith in their democracy, and many will not accept the legitimacy of this election. Those were the stark findings from a survey we performed from Oct. 6 through Oct.",
        "Remember when people thought that hashtag activism of #BringBackOurGirls was useless? Well, this week brought proof that sustained social media pressure can work. On Thursday, the Nigerian government announced that 21 of the nearly 300 girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014 had been released as a result of negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram; the Swiss government and the International Committee of the Red Cross played an active role as neutral mediators in the talks.",
        "INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES teach their officers how to respond in case of exposure: Admit nothing, deny everything, make . While perhaps good advice in the amoral context of espionage, these are not, or should not be, words to live by for those who take part in democratic politics. Yet when Republican Donald Trump was outed as a serial abuser of women, first by his own words and then by testimony from a lengthening list of alleged victims, he responded with tactics worthy of the Russian man Vladi mir Putin, whose leadership he so admires. Mr.",
        "Three Kansas men were accused of plotting a bomb attack targeting an apartment complex home to a mosque and many Muslim immigrants from Somalia, authorities said Friday. Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright and Patrick Eugene Stein face federal charges of conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction, the Department of Justice announced Friday. Curtis Allen. (Sedgwick County Sheriff\u2019s Office via AP) \u201cThese charges are based on eight months of investigation by the FBI that is alleged to have taken the investigators deep into a hidden culture of hatred and violence,\u201d Acting U.

        "A Connecticut judge on Friday agreed to dismiss a lawsuit filed against gun manufacturers and sellers by relatives of people killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012, saying that the suit was not allowed under a federal shield law. The manufacturers and sellers had argued in court filings that while the shooting was tragic, the lawsuit against them was not allowed under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, the shield law passed by Congress in 2005 after numerous lawsuits against gun manufacturers. Connecticut Superior Court Judge Barbara N.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Speaking at a rally before at least 2, 500 people at a regional airport Friday, President Obama told the enthusiastic crowd that \u2018it needed to work to elect Hillary Clinton or risk losing \u201ceverything\u201d Democrats had worked for over the past eight years. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s closing argument is, \u2018What do you have to lose?\u2019 \u201d he asked the audience. \u201cThe answer is everything. \u201d Obama alternated between touting Clinton\u2019s qualities and slamming Trump\u2019s qualifications and temperament. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t make excuses.",
        "Former senior U. S. national security officials are dismayed at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s repeated refusal to accept the judgment of intelligence professionals that Russia stole files from the Democratic National Committee computers in an effort to influence the U. S. election. The former officials, who have served presidents in both parties, say they were bewildered when Trump cast doubt on Russia\u2019s role after receiving a classified briefing on the subject and again after an unusually blunt statement from U. S. agencies saying they were \u201cconfident\u201d that Moscow had orchestrated the attacks. \u201cIt defies logic,\u201d retired Gen.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) will attempt Friday to move past a battle with Donald Trump with a fresh policy speech and news that he raised $15. 4 million to defend his majority. Ryan will argue for the value of conservative leadership in Congress in a midday address to college Republicans in his home state of Wisconsin.",
        "Ben Carson has been a standout TV surrogate for Donald Trump \u2014 but not in the way the Trump campaign might have hoped. In the months since he endorsed the Republican presidential nominee, Carson has said \u2014 among many, many other moments \u2014 that he would have \u201cpreferred\u201d a different candidate atop the GOP ticket, and that even if Trump turns out to be a bad president, America would only be stuck with him for four years. His interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Friday was so bad that it just might be the worst of the 2016 campaign.",
        "This post has been updated. Melania Trump is demanding a retraction and apology after People magazine published reporter Natasha Stoynoff\u2019s account of being pinned against a wall and kissed by Donald Trump when she interviewed both Trumps at in 2005. It is no surprise that the first lady is pushing back against the article. After being profiled by GQ in April, she blasted the story as \u201cyet another example of the dishonest media and their disingenuous reporting.",
        "If you think Donald Trump has problems, consider those of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Elected last year as a candidate to clean up Africa\u2019s biggest democracy, his popularity has fallen amid various spiraling crises \u2014 a faltering economy, a deadly insurgency, a devastating famine. And now, even his wife is skeptical. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Hausa language service, Nigerian first lady Aisha Buhari suggested that she might not back her husband\u2019s potential reelection in 2019 if he didn\u2019t shake up his government.",
        "The flooding in North Carolina hasn\u2019t ended \u2014 far from it. Water will continue above flood stage in many cities and towns through next week, and we\u2019re finally getting a chance to see exactly how much these rivers have grown since Hurricane Matthew swept through on Saturday. Princeville Princeville, N. C. has a tormented history with hurricanes. In 1999, the town was decimated when the Tar River came pouring over the city\u2019s levee and filled its streets with up to 20 feet of water.",

        "Kenneth Bone is the same person on Friday as he was on Sunday: a politically ambiguous, white Midwesterner who is suddenly a figure of widespread interest thanks to his mild, appearance during a unpalatable political event. But as a meme, Kenneth Bone has changed quite a bit. Sunday is when Kenneth Bone the person gave way to Kenneth Bone the meme. At first he was an American Hero, and even described himself as a \u201chuggable, likable guy in the middle of a really nasty and divisive debate. \u201d But then overnight on Thursday, things changed.",

        "Hillary Clinton has two important challenges in the final presidential debate on Wednesday in Las Vegas. Neither involves trying to discredit Donald Trump. The first will be to respond to and explain what has been learned from the hacking of campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s email account and other recent revelations. The second and perhaps even more important task will be to make a strong, affirmative and compelling case for a possible Clinton presidency.",
        "PORTSMOUTH, N. H. \u2014 Donald Trump suggested without evidence Saturday that Democrat Hillary Clinton might have been on drugs at their most recent debate and that the election is \u201crigged\u201d against him, adding a new round of unsubstantiated assertions to an increasingly scathing campaign. Trump\u2019s campaign also announced fundraising numbers that showed he was at a cash disadvantage against Clinton heading into October. And the nominee severed ties with the Republican Party chairman of Ohio, according to Trump\u2019s Ohio state director, highlighting the intraparty discord in a key swing state as the election nears.",
        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told CNN anchor Anderson Cooper at the second presidential debate on Oct. 9 that he had never touched women without their consent. The comment came after The Washington Post published a video of Trump bragging to \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host Billy Bush in 2005 that he could kiss and grope women without their permission because he was a celebrity. \u201cHave you ever done those things?\u201d Cooper asked at the debate. \u201cI will tell you: No, I have not,\u201d Trump responded.",
        "Cancer patients taking high doses of opioid painkillers are often afflicted by a new discomfort: constipation. Researcher Jonathan Moss thought he could help, but no drug company was interested in his ideas for relieving suffering among the dying. So Moss and his colleagues pieced together small grants and, in 1997, received permission to test their treatment. But not on cancer patients. Federal regulators urged them to use a less frail \u2014 and by then, rapidly expanding \u2014 group: addicts caught in the throes of a nationwide opioid epidemic. Suddenly, Moss said, investors were knocking at his door.",
        "EDINBURGH, Scotland \u2014 Even by the blustery standards of this notoriously land, Aug. 7 was a particularly gusty day. Bursts of rushing air swept across the green expanse of the Highlands, felling trees, submerging boats and forcing organizers to cancel food festivals and concerts. But amid the havoc, the day also brought a critical milestone in a quiet energy revolution: For the first time ever, the army of spinning white turbines that has sprouted across the lush countryside generated enough electricity to power all of Scotland.",
        "Last year, I wrote an article calling Donald Trump a godsend for moderate Republicans. Trump, I predicted, would lose so spectacularly that the GOP would be forced to transform itself, surrendering its mindless obstructionism, science denial, xenophobia and plutocracy. After a purge like that, the party would finally be able to compete in future national elections. I was wrong. I now see that Trump\u2019s candidacy has exacerbated the Republican Party\u2019s weaknesses, alienating minorities, fracturing the base and stunting smart policy development. The party\u2019s structural problems are so severe that reform is impossible."
