        "The urgent task of progressives in this election is to defeat Donald Trump. But even if we succeed, we have a responsibility: to understand why Trump happened and to face up to how failures on the left and have contributed to the flourishing of a new far right, not only in the United States but also across Europe.",
        "When Donald Trump brought three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second presidential debate last Sunday, his aides said he had three goals. He wanted to throw Hillary Clinton off her game by putting them in her sightline (although the debate committeenixed his original plan to seat them in his VIP box). He wanted to remind voters that Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency had been marked by accusations far more serious than the acts Trump described to Billy Bush on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d bus.",
        "For 27 years, I\u2019ve been in Donald Trump\u2019s crosshairs. I\u2019m a member of the Central Park Five, a group of teenagers wrongfully imprisoned after the brutal sexual assault of a jogger in Central Park in 1989. The victim, a investment banker named Trisha Meili, was bludgeoned with a rock, tied up, raped and left for dead. She was discovered hours later. When we were arrested, the police deprived us of food, drink or sleep for more than 24 hours. Under duress, we falsely confessed. Though we were innocent, we spent our formative years in prison, branded as rapists.",
        "When our son Malcolm was in the second grade, his teacher informed us that he had said a bad word \u2014 the bad word. Malcolm had been organizing pieces of a game by size and color, in a precise and evenly spaced triple matrix, when a classmate took some pieces in an attempt to actually play the game. \u201cF \u2014 ! !\u201d loudly and sharply reverberated across the room.

        "They\u2019re in demand among parents who say traditional public schools have failed \u2014 but they\u2019re not always successful. Their intense rate of growth has fueled an equally intense debate about the role they\u2019ll play in the future of U. S. education. Advocates see their expansion as evidence that parents have a huge appetite for school choice. Critics see the beginning of the end of public education, with systems of neighborhood schools replaced by independent, privately run companies without the same obligation to teach the toughest students. A great deal of confusion surrounds charter schools.",
        "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The Latest on a powerful windstorm approaching the Northwest coast (all times local): 3:20 p. m. Trees and power lines are coming down as a powerful storm hits the Northwest. Thousands of people were without power in Oregon and Washington on Saturday as the storm, bearing remnants of a Pacific typhoon, made landfall. The National Weather Service said winds were gusting above 50 mph in the Portland area and that the strongest winds would hit Seattle from about 6 p. m. to 9 p. m.",
        "Some consumers may be shying away from Wells Fargo after learning that employees used customers\u2019 information to open sham accounts, according to new figures reported by the bank. The nation\u2019s largest retail bank beat expectations when it reported more than $5. 6 billion in profit for the past three months. But the bank\u2019s earnings report also hinted that the Wells Fargo may have some trouble convincing people to open new accounts in the wake of the scandal.",
        "After Juanita Broaddrick, who has long accused former president Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978, repeated those allegations in a January tweet, aides to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton quickly moved to gather information that could be used to undermine her account, hacked internal campaign emails released Saturday by the group WikiLeaks show. There is no evidence that the campaign publicly responded to Broaddrick\u2019s tweet.",
        "Donald Trump regularly touts his business success as a rationale for his campaign. In the first presidential debate, he got specific, speaking of the recent opening of the new Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. \u201cUnder budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I\u2019m a year ahead of schedule. And that\u2019s what this country should be doing. \u201d Yet the opening hasn\u2019t been perhaps as rosy as Trump described. Earlier this year, celebrity chefs Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and Geoffrey Zakarian reversed plans to open a restaurant in the hotel after Trump made derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants.",
        "A progressive advocacy group is launching an advertising campaign accusing Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who also is the Republican nominee, of allowing voter suppression after state police raided the offices of a voter registration program aimed at signing up African Americans. Patriot Majority USA will place the ads on radio stations and in print and online with black newspapers throughout the state starting Saturday, said the group\u2019s director, Craig Varoga. Patriot Majority is affiliated with the Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC that supports Democratic candidates. On Oct.",
        "The \u201cCrusaders\u201d knew they wanted to kill Muslims \u2014 and with luck, use the \u201cbloodbath\u201d to ignite a religious war \u2014 but for months they couldn\u2019t settle on a plan. The easiest way would be to grab guns, go to the predominantly apartment complex they\u2019d been surveilling and start kicking in doors, court documents said. They would spare no one, not even babies. In the end, they decided to set off bombs similar to the one Timothy McVeigh used in 1995 to kill 168 people in Oklahoma City. They planned to strike after the Nov. 8 election, investigators said.",
        "A youth pastor at a rural Pennsylvania church has been fired and arrested on statutory sexual assault charges after police said he admitted to impregnating a girl, according to the Associated Press. Police said the youth pastor, Wesley Blackburn, told his wife he was having an affair with the girl and that he wanted a divorce, the AP reported. Distraught, Blackburn\u2019s wife reportedly turned to Jim Espenshade, the senior pastor of Faith Brethren Bible Church in New Paris, Pa. about 100 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. \u201cI was shocked. Absolutely shocked,\u201d Espenshade told WJAC News.",
        "The robe came off. A Michigan judge, growing increasingly frustrated with a defendant who was talking back to him, stormed down from his bench and rushed to help subdue the man as he resisted being handcuffed. Jackson County Circuit Court Judge John McBain (Jackson County Government) Though the incident took place in December, video footage of the scuffle was published this week on Mlive. com. It showed a rare instance of a judge physically intervening in a courtroom situation \u2014 something that at least one of the Michigan judge\u2019s colleagues said was justified in this case.",

        "Most adults don\u2019t remember learning how to crawl. But Alexandra Greeves, 31, will never forget. \u201cI had to concentrate on it,\u201d recalls the Bethesda resident, who struggled with keeping her head lifted and gaze high. She had to fight the urge to move too quickly, and constantly remind herself to drag the opposite leg forward after placing a palm on the ground. Her best teacher? A playmate who could propel himself across the floor no problem \u2014 her son.",
        "In recent years, organizing and decluttering have become synonymous concepts, but they aren\u2019t really the same thing. Although the two activities go hand in hand, the main purpose of organizing is not necessarily to discard things. Your closets and drawers can be packed but totally organized. Or, you may have a relatively house but can\u2019t ever find what you\u2019re looking for. Organizing is putting the things you own in order. Decluttering means getting rid of unwanted items that are taking up valuable space. It\u2019s possible to do both things, but decluttering alone will not make you organized.",
        "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton faces a striking choice in the final three weeks of the campaign: to expand her efforts to states that Democrats haven\u2019t won in a generation, or to stay a current course that, if conditions hold, would deliver her a resounding electoral college victory. After two tumultuous weeks focused on Donald Trump\u2019s behavior toward women, Clinton is ahead in nearly all of the key battleground states where her campaign has directed the most resources, according to many recent polls.",
        "He is preaching to the converted. He is lashing out at anyone who is not completely loyal. He is detaching himself from and delegitimizing the institutions of American political life. And he is proclaiming conspiracies everywhere \u2014 in polls (rigged) in debate moderators (biased) and in the election itself (soon to be stolen). In the presidential campaign\u2019s home stretch, Donald Trump is fully inhabiting his own echo chamber.",
        "Indiana Gov. Mike Pence delicately broke with Donald Trump on a range of topics Sunday, including his running mate\u2019s personal attacks against women who have accused him of sexual assault and on whether Russian hackers are responsible for leaking Democratic Party emails. Pence said he would not have disparaged the women who have accused Trump, even while defending Trump against the accusations. The GOP presidential nominee has been widely criticized for suggesting on several occasions that he could not have sexually assaulted several of the women because they were not attractive enough.",
        "KHAZIR, IRAQ \u2014 Iraq announced the beginning of its offensive for the northern city of Mosul on Monday, embarking on the country\u2019s biggest fight against Islamic State militants so far. In an televised address, Prime Minister Haider pledged to raise the Iraqi flag over the city once more, calling on residents to cooperate with the advancing forces. The operation aims to push the militant group out of its de facto capital in Iraq, the most populous city it controls. More than 1 million civilians are thought to be trapped in the city.",
        "Their public conference had been interrupted by a demonstration march and a bomb threat, so the white nationalists decided to meet secretly instead. They slipped past police officers and protesters into a hotel in downtown Memphis. The country had elected its first black president just a few days earlier, and now in November 2008, dozens of the world\u2019s most prominent racists wanted to strategize for the years ahead. \u201cThe fight to restore White America begins now,\u201d their agenda read.",
        "JEREMIE. LES CAYES. . These Haitian towns, blasted and shattered by Hurricane Matthew, are unfamiliar to most Americans. Yet now that the storm has left them desperate for relief, it is to Americans they are turning for the most basic forms of lifesaving help: food, water, shelter, medical supplies. Americans have stepped up generously in the past to help Haiti, the hemisphere\u2019s poorest country, notably after a cataclysmic earthquake in 2010 left at least 100, 000 dead and hundreds of thousands more without homes.",
        "While everyone fixates on the U. S. election, developments in the world economy threaten to create problems for the next president and, possibly, trigger a major financial crisis. A study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delivers the bad news. It finds that global debt \u2014 including the debts of governments, households and nonfinancial businesses \u2014 reached a record $152 trillion in 2015, an amount much higher than before the financial crisis. What\u2019s worrisome about this is that the global economic recovery has assumed widespread \u201cdeleveraging\u201d \u2014 the repayment of debt by businesses and households.",
        "The crucial phase in the war against the Islamic State is imminent; the battle to liberate the Iraqi city Mosul has begun. That has military planners speeding up preparations for the corresponding operation into Raqqa, the Syrian capital of the terror group\u2019s caliphate. But in the rush to rob the Islamic State of territory, scant attention is being paid to what happens the day after the city falls.",
        "In the fall of 2004 Vladi mir Putin suffered a blow he has never forgotten. The fraudulent election of a Ukrainian president, which Putin had directly and brazenly engineered, was overturned by a massive popular uprising. What came to be known as the \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d created a model for resistance to rigged elections in autocracies across Eurasia \u2014 in Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Azerbaijan and, in 2012, Russia itself. Most of the rebellions didn\u2019t succeed.",
        "To hear the many howls of protest from conservatives, you\u2019d think that a handful of emails released by WikiLeaks demonstrates that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is a nest of . Fortunately for her, the emails, which are four to five years old, tell a far more interesting tale about the struggles inside the Catholic Church in the period before the ascendancy of Pope Francis. All journalism relying on WikiLeaks should note our government has accused Russia of trying to influence the American election (and that the Clinton campaign has not authenticated the emails).",
        "CAMP SHORAB, Afghanistan \u2014 Earlier this month, a small district center just south of this desolate U. S. base came under attack from Taliban militants who threatened to overrun the local police. Frantic calls arrived from Afghan officials: They needed air support. In a U. S. command center, a steel hut of plywood walls and a dozen video monitors piping in drone feeds and satellite imagery, soldiers began directing aircraft to the area.",
        "On Tuesday, the president and first lady will welcome Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to the White House for what\u2019s likely to be the last state dinner of the Obama administration. It\u2019s bound to be a big, glittery affair: Celebrity chef Mario Batali will be in the kitchen, and singer Gwen Stefani will perform after dinner. In the center of it all: Renzi, 41, the youngest prime minister since Italy became a unified nation in 1861. Haven\u2019t heard of him?

        "The surviving pieces of the baby\u2019s skull are paper thin in places. There are holes in the cranium. And the infant has the classic \u201crosary bead\u201d rib deformities of the ancient childhood disease rickets. Some of the bones with the tiny skeleton on the Smithsonian lab table also show evidence of anemia. And the infant probably had scurvy, from a lack of vitamin C. Much is known about the who died in Maryland 300 years ago and was buried in a small coffin. Yet there is no record of the child\u2019s death \u2014 or birth.",
        "When Donald Trump has needed a legal brawler, he has often turned to Marc Kasowitz, a Manhattan attorney whose website cites a description of him as one of the most \u201cfeared lawyers in the United States. \u201d Kasowitz fits into the pattern of Trump pursuing confrontational legal strategies and embracing tough allies, including the late attorney Roy Cohn, who Trump said earlier this year \u201ccould be a nasty guy\u201d as he helped the businessman\u2019s real estate empire grow in Manhattan."
