        "Donald Trump is not really running a campaign for president anymore. Instead, he is involved in an extended revenge plot or is simply following the politics of grievance to a natural, unseemly end. See, campaigns have a message. They have strategy and tactics. They show restraint and coordination. Trump, in the 10 days since the release of a tape of him making lewd and sexually suggestive comments about women, has done none of those things. Literally none.",
        "When the Washington Redskins hired Scot McCloughan to become their general manager last year, he envisioned a team that could run the football, play good defense by stopping the run and grind out victories. It\u2019s an formula that has historically proved it can work in the NFL, even in this era. It took six games, but this was the closest the Redskins have looked to McCloughan\u2019s blueprint this season. Against an upstart Philadelphia Eagles squad, Washington relied on a balanced offense and a stifling defense to reel off its fourth straight victory, at FedEx Field on Sunday.",
        "It is the mystery that has consumed Bearville for much of the past week. Is Pedals the Bear dead? If so, who killed him? And why? Uproar over the fate of the beloved male American black bear, who was something of a fixture in northern New Jersey for casually strolling around neighborhoods in an upright position, reached full boil when a Facebook page devoted to Pedals posted that he had been killed last Monday in a hunt. \u201cIt is with deep sorrow that I am posting this today. . . .",
        "BANGKOK \u2014 On an ordinary Saturday night, the Soi Cowboy district in Bangkok is ablaze with neon lights as skimpily clad women in boots chat up tourists and twirl seductively around poles. But the decadent flesh parade came to an abrupt halt Thursday when soldiers marched in and shut the dance bars down. It was a gesture of respect for the country\u2019s monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died Thursday afternoon after a long illness and 70 years on the throne.",
        "Bad dates make the best stories, especially when they lead to successful setups. Just ask Aubrey Menard and Will Arndt. In early 2013, Aubrey was attending Oxford University, where she met Luke Martin, a fellow student, at a party. They became Facebook friends and agreed to meet for drinks at a nearby pub. It quickly became apparent, however, that a romantic spark wasn\u2019t there for Aubrey, despite Luke\u2019s best efforts. \u201cHe played Bon Iver to me on acoustic guitar, which was super awkward,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever had somebody play guitar [for] you, in a situation, you know.",
        "Sure, it\u2019s only October, but don\u2019t forget: Between now and the holidays, time tends to fly. So if you were planning to make holiday fruitcakes, now\u2019s the time to start. And if you weren\u2019t planning to make them, won\u2019t you reconsider? Kristen Hartke showcases three excellent (and very different) fruitcakes this week \u2014 with recipes, of course. Also in Food, Phaedra Hise travels to a Virginia farm whose owners are raising a rare and endangered species of pig that arrived here with the Spaniards 500 years ago.",
        "TUXEDO, N. Y. \u2014 Sen. Charles E. Schumer pulled up on a recent afternoon to the historic train station in this tiny Hudson Valley commuter town. But instead of jumping out of the car to greet voters who might help him win his reelection race, the New York Democrat first tended to more crucial business: a phone conversation advising a Democratic Senate candidate whose victory would help make him Senate majority leader after November.",
        "KHAZIR, Iraq \u2014 Thousands of Iraqi forces advanced toward the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Monday, the first step of a offensive seeking to drive Islamic State militants from their main stronghold in Iraq. Kurdish forces moved to take a string of villages east of the city, while Iraqi army and police units made a push from the south. Announced before dawn in a televised address by Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar the battle is the most ambitious offensive launched by Iraq\u2019s security forces since they were created after the U. S. invasion in 2003.",
        "Russia\u2019s completion this month of an integrated air defense system in Syria has made an Obama administration decision to strike Syrian government installations from the air even less likely than it has been for years, and has created a substantial obstacle to the Syrian safe zones both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have advocated.",
        "I just finished watching \u201cStranger Things,\u201d the Netflix series in which government scientists try to spy on Russians by sending a girl with telekinetic powers into a parallel universe. The plan goes awry when the girl, by opening the gate between universes, allows a faceless, monster to escape. The Demogorgon begins kidnapping and eating people in the real world, and the scientists, powerless to stop it, are themselves devoured. Watching this monster consume the very people who made it possible naturally brought to mind Donald Trump.",

        "As his campaign grows increasingly desperate and fevered, Donald Trump is becoming consumed with the idea that the entire process is rigged against him in a hundred different ways. He\u2019s especially focused on the idea that the votes themselves will be stolen \u2014 indeed, he\u2019s telling his supporters that if he should lose, that will constitute proof that the vote counting was fraudulent. According to a new Consult poll, 73 percent of Republicans say the election could be stolen from Trump by voter fraud.",
        "As WikiLeaks continues to dump John Podesta\u2019s emails onto the world, there\u2019s a cornucopia of information to digest. I decided to start by focusing on a key source of tension between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary: the transcripts of Clinton\u2019s paid speeches at Goldman Sachs. These were supposed to contain information damaging to Clinton\u2019s campaign. After reading all three speeches \u2026 I don\u2019t understand why Clinton didn\u2019t make them public back in the spring. Okay, I understand a little.",
        "The chart below represents the actual stated beliefs of the Republican Party\u2019s nominee for President of the United States. It is now clear that as a loss looms, Donald Trump will only escalate his rolling claims that the election is rigged against him. The conspiracy now includes the media, numerous women who allege inappropriate sexual advances, their friends and relatives, immigration officials, international bankers, and elections officials across the country. Yesterday, Trump tweeted that \u201cthe election is absolutely being rigged\u201d on Hillary Clinton\u2019s behalf, not just by the news media, but also \u201cat many polling places.",

        "PARK RIDGE, Ill. \u2014 Hillary Rodham was 16 when she first ran for president. It was February 1964, her junior year of high school in this town of steeples and lawns on the rail line to Chicago. She was vice president of her class, and one of five students running to lead the student council for the next academic year. Student rock bands played in support of candidates in the hallways and cafeteria of Maine East High School. \u201cStop mudslinging before it starts,\u201d the school newspaper opined. \u201cKeep this election clean!\u201d No girl had ever held the job before.",
        "Donald Trump said he would be willing to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before Inauguration Day if he is elected president, breaking sharply with precedent and showing little compunction over stepping on the heels of President Obama\u2019s final months in office. \u201cPutin has no respect at all for Obama. And I think that you have potentially a really catastrophic situation here, I\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d Trump told conservative radio host Michael Savage during an interview. \u201cI will say this, if I win on November 8th . ..",

        "This week in science news you can use, an international group of horticulturalists has published an extensive study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences looking at the effects of refrigeration on flavor compounds in tomatoes. Now, we at Speaking of Science take tomato storage very seriously (we\u2019ve written about it before). But what we truly love about this study is a single sentence from the PNAS news release about it: \u201cChilling fruits at temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius hampers enzymes that help synthesize volatile compounds, resulting in relatively fresh but insipid fruits.",

His proof? It looks like he\u2019s going to lose. Senior Republican leaders are scrambling to distance themselves from this dangerous claim. But Trump\u2019s argument didn\u2019t spring from nowhere.
