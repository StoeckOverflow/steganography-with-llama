        "As the final presidential debate looms like a Halloween pinata full of October surprises, voters may be less committed to one or the other candidate than the numbers suggest. And this, my fellow sufferers, could bode better for Donald Trump. Lest you suddenly seek the highest perch from which to hurl yourself, this is strictly my personal unscientific prediction, based on instinct, experience and conversations with hundreds of voters across the country. This isn\u2019t to say Trump will win, but it might give pause to those insisting the election is rigged.",
        "IN AN editorial Tuesday, we described how Donald Trump is attacking both halves of a fundamental and equation of American democracy: that the loser recognizes the winner and that the winner lets the loser remain in the political arena. By claiming his loss could happen only as a result of cheating, and threatening to jail Hillary Clinton if he wins, Mr. Trump is rejecting a pillar of our republic. But that is not the only pillar under assault: Mr. Trump\u2019s blanket indifference to truth is similarly an attack on democracy. All politicians fudge the truth at times.",
        "Making predictions three weeks before the U. S. election is risky, but the likeliest bet right now is that the center will hold in American politics and Hillary Clinton will be elected president. That\u2019s important for lots of reasons, the biggest of which is that it could begin to stabilize a very unsettled world. Nate Silver, a leading polling guru, projected Monday night that, based on major surveys, the chances of a Clinton victory had increased to 88 percent, up 5 points in a week and 33 points from her low ebb in September before the first debate.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re in a period analogous, truly analogous, to the time in Europe just after Gutenberg mechanized the Chinese invention of the printing press,\u201d Alberto Ibarg\u00fcen, president of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, told me. \u201cAfter Gutenberg, any Tom, Dick or Martin Luther could print whatever they want, and it took a hundred years to figure out, to sort it all out. \u201d The 11th episode of \u201cCape Up\u201d is all about the state of journalism in the age of social media. \u201cConfused,\u201d is how Ibarg\u00fcen describes it.",
        "guests are attending Tuesday night\u2019s Italian state dinner \u2014 the last of the Obama administration\u2019s and, understandably, one of the biggest. The celeb names were both surprising and somewhat logical. Among them: Chance the Rapper and his dad Kenneth Bennett, a adviser to Rahm Emmanuel. Frank Ocean, a favorite of the first couple. Funnyman Jerry Seinfeld, who the president chatted and cruised around with for \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee.",
        "\u201cConsider the source\u201d is a good rule in life, and even more so in the realm of news. In recent days, Donald Trump stood in front of crowds and argued that both candidates should undergo drug tests before the final presidential debate Wednesday. Why? Because Hillary Clinton, he claimed, is taking substances. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with her, but at the beginning of her last debate, she was all pumped up at the beginning, and at the end it was like take me down,\u201d he said. \u201cShe could barely reach her car.",
        "Kahlida Lloyd can explain her reasons for voting for Hillary Clinton, even if she is not especially excited about them. But she has a hard time making the case to obstinate friends why they should support the Democratic presidential nominee. Lloyd, 31, a lawyer, sought advice from other black millennials during a recent lunchtime gathering in downtown Washington. What should she say to encourage young black voters, who rallied in 2008 and 2012 to help Barack Obama make history as the first African American president, to show a little of that enthusiasm for Clinton?",
        "Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign needled Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday over his suggestion that if he is elected president, he might hold a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, joking that any strategy session would be redundant. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear why Donald Trump needs to meet with Vladimir Putin on November 9th since he\u2019s already repeating all his talking points, pushing his policy agenda and taking advantage of his espionage operation,\u201d Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said. \u201cRest assured that as president, Hillary Clinton will stand up to Putin in the face of his unacceptable behavior, not coddle him.",
        "Republicans, who are now telling Donald Trump to knock it off when it comes to alleging that the 2016 election is rigged, aren\u2019t just pushing back on the GOP presidential nominee \u2014 they\u2019re battling their own party\u2019s claims about voter fraud and the \u201cliberal media. \u201d Those claims laid the groundwork for what Trump is arguing today and make it that much harder to fight his ideas. Trump appears to be setting up his rationale for not actually conceding the election, instead arguing that his loss was a combination of a media conspiracy and voter fraud.",
        "The trajectory of the 2016 presidential race \u2014 which will result in a Hillary Clinton victory \u2014 remains largely unchanged from May, when Donald Trump and Clinton were in the process of wrapping up their nominations. But what has changed recently is Clinton\u2019s likely winning margin. For many weeks, even months, I have believed that Clinton would defeat Trump by three to six points. If anything, that range now looks a bit low, with the Democratic nominee apparently headed for a more convincing victory, quite possibly in the range.",
        "The number of law enforcement officers killed by suspects declined last year, falling to the number of such deaths during the Obama administration, according to FBI data released Tuesday. In 2015, there were 41 officers killed in what the FBI called \u201cfelonious acts,\u201d which overwhelmingly involved officers fatally shot during law enforcement activities. The toll declined from the 51 officers killed by suspects in the line of duty a year earlier, when more officers were killed in ambushes and during traffic stops.",
        "The D. C. Council will take up legislation to allow doctors to prescribe lethal drugs to terminally ill residents on Nov. 1, lawmakers decided Tuesday. The council opted to put the matter on its legislative agenda at the start of next month, when it will hold the first of two required votes on the bill. The council chambers were filled with people on both sides of the issue, but the lawmakers did not debate or discuss it or raise any questions. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) announced that the legislative body would take action next month.",
        "The Transportation Department\u2019s ban on the Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7 could be leaving some users in a lurch if they try to bring the phone on any flight going to or from any part of the United States. To help those folks, Samsung is setting up exchange booths at airports to offer customers another Samsung phone in exchange for their faulty Notes. In a statement, Samsung said booths in the United States will be at \u201csome of the most frequently visited airports around the country,\u201d but it did not provide a full list of airports.",
        "The woman stopped her car in the middle of a residential neighborhood in Edina, one of Minnesota\u2019s wealthiest suburbs. Just moments before, she had passed a black man who had been walking on the shoulder of the street, seemingly to avoid construction along the sidewalk. After passing the man, the woman noticed an unmarked police car behind her activate its lights. The vehicle pulled in front of the pedestrian and cut him off; a plainclothes officer emerged and accused the man of walking in the middle of the road.",
        "Oh, Canada. You\u2019re making us blush. Our neighbors to the north have watched from afar a U. S. election cycle that has broken all norms for civility. It\u2019s created tremendous stress and surfaced deep tensions within our society. For many, it\u2019s been disheartening and demoralizing to watch. But Canadians are here to offer a sympathetic message to lift Americans\u2019 spirits. Riffing off Donald Trump\u2019s slogan, the Garden, a creative agency in Toronto, launched a campaign called \u201cLet\u2019s Tell America It\u2019s Great. \u201d It encouraged Canadians to send videos of themselves telling America all the reasons it\u2019s already great.",
        "Paul Woodside was just a child when Richard Streicher Jr. died in 1935. They were both 7 years old, and they knew each other from school. \u201cWe walked home from school together,\u201d Woodside told MLive. com. \u201cHe lived up there on Cross Street. I lived on Prospect Street. We separated right there. And that was the last I see him. I was probably one of the last people to see him alive, besides the killer, I guess. \u201d Richard went out sledding that day in 1935 and never returned, according to news reports.",
        "Republican nominee Donald Trump said during the early moments of the third presidential debate that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. \u201cThat will happen automatically, in my opinion. Because I am putting justices on the court,\u201d Trump said, in response to a question from moderator Chris Wallace. Trump said he wanted to leave the decision about whether to legalize abortions to individual states.",
        "Malik Obama is exactly the kind of man that Donald Trump says he\u2019d like to keep out of the United States. He\u2019s a Muslim. He comes from Kenya, a country that has been racked by unrest in recent years and has been the target of terrorists from Somalia, who have fashioned themselves as Islamists. He currently has between three and 12 wives \u2014 he won\u2019t say exactly how many \u2014 and, clearly, doesn\u2019t adhere to traditional American family values, however you might define them. But Malik Obama is a naturalized U. S.",
        "LAS VEGAS \u2014 If Donald Trump says the word \u201crigged\u201d five times or more during tonight\u2019s debate, bookies will be paying out. Oddsmakers are even taking bets on whether the presidential candidates will shake hands. Gambling on politics is forbidden in the United States, but informal betting still goes on in this city that is all about the odds. And offshore gambling operations are reporting a surge in wagers not only on who will be the next U. S. president, but even what the point spread will be in Ohio.",
        "If Donald Trump were to come back to beat Hillary Clinton in the contest for the White House, it\u2019d be the biggest late comeback in the history of presidential polling. But amazingly, Senate and House Republicans have managed to avoid falling down with him. That could change. Trump\u2019s numbers are teetering on a precarious edge, and so are Republicans who have to share the ballot with him. Many political observers think if Trump is down by 10 points or more in states with competitive Senate and House races, those candidates will have a nearly impossible time hanging on.",
        "HILLSBOROUGH, N. C. \u2014 The supplies inside their firebombed office had burned to ashes and now smelled like exhaust, but the volunteers at the heart of the Orange County Republican Party vowed to keep working. They pulled out the flagpole, topped with a brass eagle, and unfurled a blackened red, white and blue flag. They planted melted \u201c \u201d lawn signs on a small patch of grass, set out folding tables and took to their phones to resume encouraging people to vote. Instead, the phones kept ringing with callers who wanted to encourage the volunteers.",
        "A specter is haunting academia, the specter of specters \u2014 ghosts, goblins and \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d through insensitive Halloween costumes. Institutions of higher education are engaged in the low comedy of avoiding the agonies of Yale University. Last October, the university was rocked to its foundations by the wife of a residential college master (a title subsequently expunged from Yale\u2019s vocabulary lest it trigger traumas by reminding people that slavery once existed). In response to a university memorandum urging students to wear culturally sensitive costumes \u2014 e. g.",
        "Once prohibited \u2014 indeed, unthinkable \u2014 the euthanasia of people with mental illnesses or cognitive disorders, including dementia, is now a common occurrence in Belgium and the Netherlands. This profoundly troubling fact of modern European life is confirmed by the latest biennial report from Belgium\u2019s Federal Commission on the Control and Evaluation of Euthanasia, presented to Parliament on Oct. 7. Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for patients suffering \u201cunbearably\u201d from any \u201cuntreatable\u201d medical condition, terminal or including psychiatric ones.",
        "Debbie Mukamal is executive director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center at Stanford Law School. David Sklansky is a professor at Stanford Law School and a faculty of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center. The relentless drumbeat of black men shot dead by police continues, leaving community after community anguished, angry and seeking justice. The protests this month over the killings of Carnell Snell Jr. in Los Angeles and Alfred Olango in El Cajon, Calif. underscore once again the desperate need to assure all Americans that the system values their lives and is committed to ridding itself of racial bias.",
        "Armstrong Williams is a media entrepreneur and political commentator. This month marks two historic occasions: the inauguration of the National Museum of African American History and Culture on the Mall and the 25th anniversary of the confirmation of Clarence Thomas as the second black Supreme Court justice. Ideally, the two historic moments should converge in a celebration of the journey of progress of African Americans up from slavery to their rightful place among the pantheon of American life and culture. But it\u2019s obvious that won\u2019t be the case.",
        "In 2008, Barack Obama promised the country \u201chope and change. \u201d In 2012, Mitt Romney boasted of \u201cbinders full of women. \u201d The 2016 election season has been nothing if not memorable, but what are the quotes, slogans and catchphrases that will stay with us after Nov. 8 (or Nov. 28)? From zingers to gaffes and everything in between, here are some sayings that, for better or for worse, we may still remember when 2020 rolls around \u2014 whether the people behind them want us to or not. Let us know in the comments what we\u2019re missing.",
        "PRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019S legacy will include significant, if temporary, curbs on Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 but not the broader detente with the Islamic republic that he hoped for. More and bitter evidence of that came Tuesday, when Tehran announced that two American citizens and a permanent U. S. resident had been sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of \u201ccooperating with the hostile U. S. government.",
        "Ecuador treated Julian Assange like a trophy in 2012 when it opened the doors of its London embassy to the WikiLeaks founder, sheltering him from extradition to\u00c2 Sweden over rape\u00c2 allegations\u00c2 and, possibly, \u00c2 to the United States. Rafael Correa, Ecuador s leftist president, seemed to bask in Assange s glow, which gave the small South American nation a big role in a global drama. Protecting the WikiLeaks editor also gave Correa a way to poke Washington in the eye and look like a champion for press freedom even as he cracked down on journalists back home.",
        "For the eighth straight October, the National Football League has gone pink. Players wear pink gloves, cleats, hats and towels. Referees blow pink whistles. The league drops a pink ribbon beneath its shield on footballs. All of these displays are part of the league\u2019s partnership with the American Cancer Society to raise money and consciousness during breast cancer awareness month. On many high school athletic fields, players also are going pink, incorporating the colored gear into uniforms and sideline gear and apparel. Retailers have responded by pushing the pink gear front and center on store floor space and websites.",
        "Scott Foval and Robert Creamer, two but influential Democratic political operatives, have left their jobs after video investigations by James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Project Veritas Action found Foval entertaining dark notions about how to win elections. Foval was laid off Monday by Americans United for Change, where he had been national field director; Creamer announced Tuesday night that he was \u201cstepping back\u201d from the work he was doing for the unified Democratic campaign for Hillary Clinton. The moves came after 36 hours of coverage, led by conservative and social media, for O\u2019Keefe\u2019s video series \u201cRigging the Election."
