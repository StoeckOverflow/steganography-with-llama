        "Top Republicans still believe they can retain control of the House of Representatives next year, but admit that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is \u201dadding a layer of uncertainty\u201d in the closing weeks of the election season.",
        "Laura Benanti returned to \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d Tuesday to reprise her parody of Melania Trump \u2014 this time with some uncomfortable Billy Bush references. The Tony actress wowed Colbert\u2019s audience (and the Internet) in July when she spoofed Melania Trump\u2019s Republican National Convention speech, revealed to have lifted passages from Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 address to the Democratic National Convention. On Tuesday, Benanti mocked Melania Trump\u2019s recent interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper.",
        "Children who start getting vaccinated against human papillomavirus before 15 need only two doses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided Wednesday. Its previous recommendation was for a regimen, but studies have shown that two doses work just as well. Experts predict that the simpler, more flexible timeline will result in higher rates of HPV vaccination, which has lagged among both girls and boys. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which counsels the CDC on the nation\u2019s vaccine schedule, voted Wednesday for the change. Several hours later, CDC Director Tom Frieden accepted the panel\u2019s action.",
        "TORONTO \u2014 Surely there has been something in baseball history more improbable than Ryan Merritt appearing out of some instructional league in the desert, on a Wednesday in deep October, to smother the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 fearsome lineup for half a game and help pitch the Cleveland Indians into the World Series. Wasn\u2019t there a kid with a bat called Wonderboy who many years later hit a big home run into the light stanchion?",
        "In his famous 1963 speech, President John F. Kennedy proclaimed to the world, \u201cIch bin ein Berliner,\u201d showing solidarity with a divided city at the center of the Cold War. But new revelations suggest that he was far more circumspect about those fleeing East Berlin\u2019s brutal communist regime. The new book \u201cThe Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill\u201d shows the behind the scenes at one of the most pivotal moments in the standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union.",
        "For years, world leaders have been arguing over the best way to protect the chilly Southern Ocean at the bottom of the world from threats like pollution and overfishing. Now, they may finally be one step closer to an agreement. This week, members of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) are convening in Hobart, Australia, for an annual meeting, where they will discuss the conservation and management of the Southern Ocean. And one of their priorities will be to continue negotiations on proposed marine protected areas, or MPAs, that have proved challenging.",
        "NEW DELHI \u2014 Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi said this week that it will \u201ctake time\u201d to address her country\u2019s ongoing humanitarian crisis and deflected charges that she has not done enough to speak out on behalf of Burma\u2019s persecuted Rohingya Muslim community. Suu Kyi spoke to The Washington Post as her administration marks six months in office, and as fresh violence threatens to derail the country\u2019s peace process.",
        "As the operation to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul gets underway, American troops are poised to expand their support to local forces battling the Islamic State. In a sign of the importance of the offensive, military leaders are authorized to place U. S. forces advisers with Iraqi army battalions for the first time as they push toward militant lines, exposing U. S. forces to greater risks. Military officials say the troops will remain away from the thick of combat and will limit their support to coordinating airstrikes and artillery fire, providing intelligence and helping plan troop movements.",

        "LAS VEGAS \u2014 A wave of apprehension and anguish swept the Republican Party on Thursday, with many GOP leaders alarmed by Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the outcome of the election and concluding that it is probably too late to salvage his flailing presidential campaign. As the Republican nominee reeled from a turbulent performance in the final debate here in Las Vegas, his party\u2019s embattled senators and House members scrambled to protect their seats and preserve the GOP\u2019s congressional majorities against what Republicans privately acknowledge could be a landslide victory for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.",
        "PHOENIX \u2014 A year ago, few who have watched first lady Michelle Obama only reluctantly participate in the of campaigning would have predicted that she might emerge in this election\u2019s final weeks as Hillary Clinton\u2019s most potent surrogate. But after a rousing speech last week in New Hampshire in which she passionately renounced Republican Donald Trump, and another in Arizona on Thursday making the case for Clinton\u2019s vision for the presidency, Obama has demonstrated an ability to do what Clinton herself has struggled with for much of her campaign: explain why voters should vote for her.",
        "Another woman came forward Thursday to accuse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of inappropriate physical contact, alleging that Trump unexpectedly put his arm around her and touched her breast while attending the U. S. Open tennis tournament in 1998. Karena Virginia, who was 27 at the time, said she had attended a match with a group of doctors while working as a pharmaceutical representative. Her companions had left, and she was waiting alone outside the tennis complex to be picked up by a car service when she encountered Trump.",
        "HAZLETON, Pa. \u2014 A sliding door inside Cusat\u2019s Caf\u00e9 separates the restaurant from the bar, where smoking is allowed, pizza is \u201cpitz\u201d and a can of cold Yuengling is $1. The mayor, who had to give up ownership of the place once he took office, lives upstairs. He grew up there and lived in three other spots around the block before returning for good. \u201cI moved four times,\u201d Jeff Cusat said, \u201cand the view out my front window never changed. \u201d On Wednesday night shortly before 8 p. m.",
        "EFRAT, West Bank \u2014 The gathering wasn\u2019t exactly unprecedented. Jewish settlers and their Palestinian neighbors have met quietly before, many times. But not like this. This meeting, this was rare. The settlement of Efrat is a bedroom community of 10, 000 affluent Jews, including many Americans, a few miles south of Bethlehem in the West Bank. The residents of Efrat live the good life in a growing hilltop community that the United States considers illegal and an obstacle to peace.",
        "The case against Hillary Clinton could have been written before the recent WikiLeaks and FBI disclosures. But these documents do provide hard textual backup. The most sensational disclosure was the proposed deal between the State Department and the FBI in which the FBI would declassify a Clinton email and State would give the FBI more slots in overseas stations. What made it sensational was the rare appearance in an official account of the phrase \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d which is the currently dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable corruption. This is nonetheless an odd choice for most egregious offense.",
        "Reality TV is about winning. It doesn\u2019t matter how you manage to be a \u201csurvivor,\u201d so long as you stay on the island. That\u2019s the sensibility that Donald Trump, the ultimate star, brings to foreign policy. In Trump\u2019s world, winners don\u2019t have to worry about alliances, nuclear proliferation or human rights \u2014 if they come out on top. Trump\u2019s comments during Wednesday night\u2019s debate in Las Vegas conveyed a approach to foreign policy that would make Machiavelli blush. A generous characterization would be that he voiced an extreme \u201crealism\u201d that focused entirely on U. S. interests.",
        "If anyone is rigging the election against Donald Trump, it\u2019s Donald Trump \u2014 by disempowering his own voters. Yes, Trump once (accidentally, presumably) told to \u201cmake sure you get out and vote Nov. 28,\u201d which would be 20 days after the polls close. But that isolated goof isn\u2019t what will do him in. Instead, it\u2019s the fact that he has told his supporters, repeatedly, that the election is \u201crigged\u201d by a vast global conspiracy that will never let him win \u2014 i. e.",
        "The battle for Mosul will soon demonstrate that the key to success against the Islamic State is not that Washington should have surprised itor \u201cbombed the hell\u201d out of it. About 100, 000 coalition forces are involved in helping to liberate the city, backed by formidable U. S. air power. They will face at most 5, 000 Islamic State fighters. The struggle might be bloody, but the coalition will win. The problem: A battlefield victory could be irrelevant. When Donald Trump rails against the Obama administration for having signaled its intention to retake Mosul, he is, as usual, .",
        "At last night\u2019s debate, Donald Trump falsely asserted that the city of Aleppo has fallen to the Assad regime and its Russian partners and concluded there\u2019s nothing the United States can do about it. \u201cWell Aleppo is a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a humanitarian nightmare, but it has fallen from any standpoint. What do you need, a signed document?\u201d That\u2019s not true today, but given the latest White House decision to delay any action to respond to the crisis, President Obama may be ensuring that Trump\u2019s vision of a fallen Aleppo becomes a reality.",
        "IF PRESENT trends continue \u2014 and we emphasize \u201cif\u201d \u2014 Hillary Clinton will be elected president on Nov. 8, in an ironic conclusion to a political year that supposedly belonged to outsiders and populists such as Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( . ). Why has Ms. Clinton, the \u201cestablishment\u201d alternative facing the voters, wound up in the lead at this late date? According to much conventional wisdom, she is the beneficiary of structural factors, such as voter demographics, and of good fortune \u2014 in the form of the Republican Party\u2019s spectacularly irresponsible choice of an incompetent nominee.",
        "BARTELLA, Iraq \u2014 Iraq\u2019s elite counterterrorism units advanced to within six miles of Mosul on Thursday as Kurdish forces opened a new front to the north \u2014 in a significant escalation of the fight for the Islamic city. Plumes of dust and smoke rose over the town of Bartella, east of Mosul, as Islamic State militants sent a barrage of car bombs to repel the advance of the counterterrorism forces. But by nightfall, the militants\u2019 resistance had crumbled and the Iraqi flag had been raised over the town\u2019s main church, commanders said.",
        "Federal prosecutors in Baltimore on Thursday said they will charge a former National Security Agency contractor with violating the Espionage Act, alleging that he made off with \u201can astonishing quantity\u201d of classified digital and other data over 20 years in what is thought to be the largest theft of classified government material ever. In a memo, U. S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein and two other prosecutors laid out a much more case against Harold T. Martin III than was previously outlined.",
        "SEAFORD, VA. \u201d It looks like a mad scientist s lab, something straight out of a novel. Valves turn in every direction. Tubes are stacked halfway to the ceiling. Tiny bubbles dance in large vats of water. But what s happening in a hangar of the York River Treatment Plant is real, part of a grand experiment that could help keep this coastal region from continuing to subside and eventually be claimed by the rising sea.",
        "There is one corner of Washington where Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is treated as a mere distraction and where bipartisanship reigns. In the rarefied world of the Washington foreign policy establishment, President Obama\u2019s departure from the White House \u2014 and the possible return of a more conventional and hawkish Hillary Clinton \u2014 is being met with quiet relief.",
        "John Podesta is constantly being asked to lunch. John Podesta receives a cascade of boring news briefs. John Podesta is a suggestion box for people who have ideas about the campaign. John Podesta and his wife, Mary, have a typical . We know this because WikiLeaks dumped the contents of his Gmail inbox into the public square this month. \u201cHappy anniversary. tried calling a couple of times but no pickup. \u201d \u201cCVS called. I assume I should pick up your Rx?\u201d \u201cshould be home around 7:30. Happy to use cabbage to make curry if that grabs you.",
        "Joe Scarborough really hates it when people say his MSNBC morning show boosted Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy during the Republican primary. All that frustration poured out Thursday morning when the former GOP congressman got into a heated argument with Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, who suggested \u201dMorning Joe\u201d enabled the eventual nominee early in the campaign. \u201dThis show was really tough on Trump in late 2015 and early 2016,\u201d Kristol said, his remark dripping with sarcasm. \u201dPlease don\u2019t come on my air and lie,\u201d Scarborough replied. And the fight was on. SCARBOROUGH: I can\u2019t even believe you\u2019re doing this.",
        "The final presidential debate once again demonstrated Donald Trump\u2019s thin grasp of the facts and his willingness to make poorly sourced or inaccurate claims. Hillary Clinton, for the most part, was more factually accurate. Here\u2019s a roundup of 24 of the more notable claims. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of claims in debates. \u201cWe have 33, 000 people a year who die from guns.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 Furious over Russia\u2019s bombardment of Aleppo, European leaders warned the Kremlin on Thursday that it could face consequences if it maintains its offensive against the besieged part of the Syrian city, although they fell short of the unity required to impose new sanctions. The sharp rhetoric was a substantial departure for European leaders, who have long been focused on when they can dial back existing sanctions on Russia, not ramp them up. Instead, Russian actions in recent weeks have upended the conversation.",
        "CHARLOTTESVILLE \u2014 Journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely fired off an email to Rolling Stone editors in the middle of the night with a sobering subject line: \u201cOur worst nightmare. \u201d She wrote that she no longer trusted \u201cJackie,\u201d the central figure in her article about a gang rape at the University of Virginia and that she believed the magazine should issue a retraction. As an attorney representing a university administrator who is suing Rolling Stone over the piece read the email aloud in court Thursday, Erdely broke down. \u201cAre those your words?\u201d attorney Libby Locke asked.",
        "A year ago, a study about U. S. hospitals marking up prices by 1, 000 percent generated headlines and outrage around the country. Twenty of those priciest hospitals are in Florida, and researchers at the University of Miami wanted to find out whether the negative publicity put pressure on the community hospitals to lower their charges. Hospitals are allowed to change their prices at any time, but many are growing more sensitive about their reputations. What the researchers found, however, was that naming and shaming did not work."
