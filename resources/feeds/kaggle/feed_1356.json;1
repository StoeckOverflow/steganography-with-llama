        "Astronomers can\u2019t see \u201cPlanet Nine. \u201d But it makes its presence known. The massive hypothetical object, which supposedly looms at the edge of our solar system, has been invoked to explain the strange clustering of objects in the Kuiper belt and the unusual way they orbit the Sun. Now Planet Nine predictors Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown of Caltech, along with graduate student Elizabeth Bailey, offer another piece of evidence for the elusive sphere\u2019s existence: It adds \u201cwobble\u201d to the solar system, they say, tilting it in relation to the sun.",

That bobcat skulking along a ridge? Actually a pile of rocks. The golden eagle eying rodents from above? Just a gnarled tree stump. But on this walk in Palo Duro Canyon State Park, what I saw high atop a nearby mesa was no Texan trompe l\u2019oeil: A Barbary sheep sat silhouetted against the midday sun.",
        "FLETCHER, N. C. \u2014 As he took the stage here in this mountain town Friday afternoon, Donald Trump was as subdued as the modest crowd that turned out to see him. He complained about the usual things \u2014 the dishonest media, his \u201ccorrupt\u201d rival Hillary Clinton \u2014 but his voice was hoarse and his heart didn\u2019t seem in it. He also promised to do all that he could to win, but explained why he might lose. \u201cWhat a waste of time if we don\u2019t pull this off,\u201d Trump said.",
        "CLAYTON, Mo. \u2014 As his motorcade barreled into a fundraiser in this wealthy St. Louis suburb recently, Vice President Biden noticed the firehouse next door. He told his aides to cut the fundraiser short a few minutes so that he and the Democrat running for Senate here could visit with the firefighters on the way out. These were his people, and for more than 10 minutes Biden talked to the fire company about what they do and how members of his own family had been saved by their work.",
        "In the fall of 1976, Fred Trump made a rare visit to a housing complex he owned in Seat Pleasant, Md. For months, Prince George\u2019s County inspectors had complained of broken windows, rotted rain gutters and missing fire extinguishers at the Gregory Estates. When the problems weren\u2019t fixed, officials asked Trump to come down and meet in person. The \u201cmeeting\u201d however, was brief. As soon as the multimillionaire arrived, he was arrested and \u2014 to his outrage \u2014 briefly jailed. The incident came at an awkward time for the Trump family.",
        "Has the Declaration of Independence been defaced? Did someone rewrite and enhance signatures on the hallowed parchment? And is that \u2014 and the grimy handprint on the document \u2014 the result of bungling? Two retired experts with the National Archives who have carefully scrutinized the Declaration think the answers all are yes. Sometime between 1903 and 1940, officials with access to the Declaration of Independence marred the treasured document, rewriting or overwriting famous signatures and leaving behind a print of a left hand, the experts think.",
        "A key part of the Internet\u2019s infrastructure was hit by a series of attacks Friday, causing major services such as Twitter, Spotify and PayPal to be inaccessible for many users around the world. The attacks targeted Dyn, a company that helps people connect to websites, with a huge amount of traffic in an attempt to knock the service offline, the firm said. The incident showed how a digital assault on just one company can disrupt a huge chunk of the Internet.",
        "Even as the country recoils, justifiably, from the prospect of Donald Trump threatening not to respect the election results, let us not lose sight of the mounting evidence of Trump\u2019s mistreatment of women \u2014 and his offensive debate dismissal of their claims. At the second debate, Trump claimed that his taped boasting about grabbing women without consent was just that \u2014 all talk, no action. In the 10 days before the third debate, nine women came forward to dispute that assertion.",
        "Lev Golinkin is the author of the memoir \u201cA Backpack, a Bear, and Eight Crates of Vodka. \u201d I doubt my mother would pass the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d process Donald Trump has in mind for refugees seeking a new life in the United States. After 26 years in this country, she still speaks with a heavy accent, misplaces tenses, mumbles. She doesn\u2019t know the Pledge of Allegiance. Her job as a night security guard requires staying awake and making sure the doors stay locked, the perfect position for an immigrant like her.",
        "Then: \u201cThe extension of the franchise to black citizens was strongly resisted. Among others, the Ku Klux Klan . . . attempted to prevent the 15th Amendment from being enforced by violence and intimidation.",
        "If Beltway insiders and other East Coast elites ever wondered why so many Americans prefer Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton, all they need do is watch a rerun of Thursday night\u2019s 71st annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. There they were in their finery, from the institutions of church, state and the Fourth Estate \u2014 including the two aforementioned presidential candidates; Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the evening\u2019s host; and, hardly least, Maria Bartiromo\u2019s decolletage.",
        "MILWAUKEE In 49 states, when you order breakfast in a restaurant you might be asked if you would like pancakes or an omelet. In Wisconsin, you are asked if you would like pancakes with your omelet. Ron Johnson would, thank you. This Republican U. S. senator, who is burning prodigious amounts of calories campaigning for a second and final term, really does represent the hearty eaters who were fueling up at a Perkins Restaurant here on a recent Sunday morning.",
        "\u201cTHIS IS having nothing to do with me but having to do with the future of our country,\u201d Donald Trump said Thursday. That statement could have been the punch line to a joke at that night\u2019s Al Smith charity dinner; Mr. Trump\u2019s ego and thin skin have been defining elements of his campaign. In fact, Mr. Trump spoke these words at a rally earlier in the day, attempting to explain his inexplicable refusal to commit to abiding by next month\u2019s election results. In a way, he was right. Mr.",
        "In what some analysts are calling an unprecedented \u201cseismic shift\u201d for the media and technology world, AT&T may soon buy the entertainment company Time Warner, a deal that could turn the legacy telecom carrier into a media titan the likes of which America has never seen. A combination between the two companies could rival some of the biggest mergers in history, with AT&T potentially gaining control over hugely valuable brands spanning television, film, sports, news, video games and mobile and residential Internet service.",
        "Ronald Reagan\u2019s house is falling apart. We don\u2019t mean his beloved Republican Party. We\u2019re talking about an actual house, the one Reagan called home during his childhood in Dixon, Ill. Last month, the executive director of the Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home Preservation Foundation sent out an urgent appeal for funds to fix rotting siding, moldy bathrooms, aging roofs and other signs of deferred maintenance. \u201cAfter 32 years of being open to visitors from all parts of the world, the home in which Ronald Reagan spent part of his formative years has fallen into disrepair,\u201d wrote Patrick Gorman.",
        "Russian authorities have asked local U. S. officials if they can observe polling locations in at least three American states on Election Day, but they were rejected amid intense scrutiny of that country\u2019s actions regarding the upcoming elections. Foreign observers have come to the United States to monitor elections before, so such visits are not rare, but Russia\u2019s requests came as American officials are examining efforts by the Kremlin to interfere with the 2016 race. Earlier this month, the U. S. government formally accused Russia of trying to interfere with the electoral process.",
        "In a letter to the Pentagon Friday, U. S. Rep. Duncan Hunter said he was concerned a contract to provide Internet service to deployed soldiers could allow the use of Russian satellites, jeopardizing troops\u2019 privacy and security. Previous service at bases\u2019 Internet cafes had \u201cstringent security measures,\u201d Hunter wrote to Army Lt. Gen. Alan Lynn, the head of the Defense Information Systems Agency.",
        "KOCHI, INDIA \u2014 The dogcatcher tiptoes into a narrow lane carrying a metal wire noose. Someone had spotted a stray dog amid rows of coconut trees a few minutes ago. \u201cFinish that dog today,\u201d one woman calls out from her porch. Another says the dog killed half the ducks in his farm. A third complains the dog has been growling at his son all week. When he corners the skinny brown dog and tightens the wire around its neck, residents cheer and turn on their cellphone cameras.",
        "The story of Humayun Khan \u2014 and his parents \u2014 became common knowledge during the Democratic National Convention. Khan, a Muslim American soldier, was killed in Iraq in 2004 when he ran toward a suicide bomber, saving the lives of the men he was in charge of. Khizr Khan, the soldier\u2019s father, told the story of his son\u2019s life and sacrifice powerfully at the convention \u2014 while chiding Donald Trump for his comments about banning Muslims from entering the country. Trump attacked Khan as a Democratic shill, playing on grief to help elect Clinton. Khizr Khan is back.",
        "In the final presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said something that received little attention from the mainstream media: \u201cMosul is on the border of Syria. \u201d Whether that statement is correct depends on your definition of \u201con the border. \u201d Mosul, in northern Iraq, is roughly 75 miles from Syria.",
        "Since May 1, shortly before Donald Trump clinched the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for president, Trump has led Hillary Clinton in the national RealClearPolitics polling average for eight days. Specifically: May 21 through 24, while Clinton was waiting for Bernie Sanders to concede, and July 24 through 27, right after Trump\u2019s convention. On every other day \u2014 165 of them, to be specific \u2014 Clinton has led, by an average of 4. 4 points.",
        "ALEPPO, Syria \u2014 There weren\u2019t any bombs today, or the day before. That\u2019s good, because it means you can leave your apartment, see your friends, try to pretend life is normal. Still, you don\u2019t know when the attacks will resume or how much worse they\u2019ll be when they do. The war here has been going on for more than four years. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled, and thousands more are dead, including many of my friends. My wife and I are among about 250, 000 people trapped here in the besieged eastern section of the city.",
        "In his long career as an accomplished journalist working across the American South, Steve Crump has come with hatred and bigotry. The journalist spent time reporting on the Ku Klux Klan in which he, a black man, interviewed members of the organization, people who by their very membership profess to hate him due to the color of his skin. For all that, though, Crump, 59, told The Washington Post that he\u2019s never felt the blunt hatred he did in Charleston, S. C. on Oct. 8.",
        "\u201cI repeat many times in the course of discussions that Charlotte Brooks is the most inconspicuous and successful photographer that I have ever heard of. You forget she is in the room and pay her no attention, and she goes about her business and takes a successful picture. \u201d This was said of photographer Charlotte Brooks not by critic or curator, but by one of the women she photographed, Connie M. Guion.",
        "AUSTIN \u2014 Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson has pushed back on a rumor that his running mate will quit to prevent a Republican victory in November, telling an audience in Texas that it was best described by an unprintable word. \u201dOccasionally you get a question that is just so out of left field that I answered it with: \u201d Johnson said at the annual Texas Tribune Festival.",
        "Even if he loses, Donald Trump isn\u2019t going away. But the man and the political phenomenon he has unleashed over the past 16 months are already posing a difficult question: Has Trump transformed America, or simply revealed it? Trump\u2019s march to the Republican nomination and on into this fall is perhaps the ultimate blending of entertainment and politics, a coarse yet mesmerizing new show that appears to have changed political language and deepened divisions in an already polarized nation.",
        "GETTYSBURG, Pa. \u2014 Anne O\u2019Reilly, a lifelong Republican activist, was in the audience here waiting for Donald Trump to arrive Saturday morning. She remains hopeful that Trump can win the presidency but has no doubt what will happen if he doesn\u2019t. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be an eggbeater in the Republican Party,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see pieces going all over the place.",
        "In Gettysburg, Pa. on Saturday, Donald Trump delivered what was billed by his campaign as a \u201cgroundbreaking contract for the American voter. \u201d It was nothing of the sort. In fact, these were the same ideas he has been spouting for weeks and months. About the only new and noteworthy things, in fact, were: His threat to break up media companies. His promise to sue the women who have accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct \u2014 after the election. \u201cEvery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTotal fabrication.",
        "Even now, the people of Flint, Mich. cannot trust what flows from their taps. More than one year after government officials finally acknowledged that an entire city\u2019s water system was contaminated by lead, many residents still rely on bottled water for drinking, cooking and bathing. Parents still worry about their kids. Promised aid has yet to arrive. In ways large and small, the crisis continues to shape daily life. From the pulpit some Sunday mornings, the Rev. Rigel Dawson can see it.",
        "AT&T said Saturday it had agreed to a blockbuster $85. 4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, a move that would turn America\u2019s most storied telecom company into one of the most prominent TV, film and producers in the world. The deal casts a spotlight on a defining movement for the giants of modern tech: Their accelerating conquest of media in an increasingly unbundled world."
