        "Best and worst moments from the Redskins\u2019 loss to the Lions at Ford Field in Detroit on Sunday. Best homecoming performance: With dozens of friends and family members in the stands, it appeared former Holland (Mich.) Christian High and Michigan State star Kirk Cousins would be a winner in his first pro game in his home state. Cousins, who completed 30 of 39 passes for 301 yards and a touchdown, gave the Redskins a lead on a QB keeper with 1:05 to play. Cousins SPEED! @KirkCousins8\u2019s TD run gives the @redskins the LEAD in Detroit! #HTTR #WASvsDET https: .",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 The final outs somehow fit. Wrigley Field was about to burst Saturday night when Yasiel Puig stepped to the plate, one out, man on first. Aroldis Chapman, inarguably among the best closers in the game, threw heat, and Puig hit a bouncer to short. As Wrigley\u2019s eyes widened, Addison Russell took the grounder and flipped to Javier Baez for the force at second. Baez screamed a throw to first, where Anthony Rizzo recorded the out that put the Cubs into their first World Series since 1945.",
        "On Sunday night, the Bill Murray is expected to take the stage at the Kennedy Center and accept the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, an award he actively avoided receiving. Last week he told The Washington Post\u2019s Geoff Edgers, \u201cI really thought if I don\u2019t answer the phone for awhile, maybe they\u2019ll just move on to someone else. \u201d They didn\u2019t. They called and called, and then had other people call, and eventually, Murray gave in. This month, the same tactic was used by the Swedish Academy, who is responsible for awarding the Nobel prizes.",
        "I find it fascinating to see the depth of information that researchers can learn about the food we eat. Beyond the nutritional value of meals, scientists are working to uncover how certain foods should be eaten, what they should be combined with and how they are best absorbed. It\u2019s a lot of science to take in, but I\u2019ve waded through the research to uncover these eight amazing tweaks to make \u201c \u201d foods even better at your next meal. Making curry? Add black pepper.",
        "I\u2019m not sure what I hate being called more: a single mother or a single mother by choice. The first term is technically true. I have a son. And I am not, nor have I ever been, married. Nor do I have any particular desire to be \u2014 although I do expect to date and to be in relationships, as I have been for most of my adult life. What is there to like about being labeled a single mother? The term only distances me from other families, making my son and me seem different, lesser, wanting.",
        "A periodic look at my recent communication with readers.   Like a number of restaurants, Kapnos Kouzina in Bethesda has a policy of not seating customers until the entire party is present. But what happens when one of the guests is a    parking his car, another is his    wife with a pacemaker, and the dining room isn t at full tilt?",
        "GOFFSTOWN, N. H. \u2014 Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump each launched fresh attacks against the other on Monday, signaling that harshly negative closing arguments may dominate the final two weeks of the campaign. Clinton\u2019s campaign tried to build on its case that Trump doesn\u2019t respect women, while Trump again questioned the integrity of the election process \u2014 this time asserting that polls showing Clinton ahead across the country are \u201cphony\u201d and \u201crigged. \u201d Perhaps the most intense rhetoric of the day came from Sen.",
        "BURLINGTON, Vt.  \u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, a loyal soldier for Hillary Clinton since he conceded the Democratic presidential nomination in July, plans to push liberal legislation with   senators with or without Clinton s support if she is elected  \u201d and to aggressively oppose appointments that do not pass muster with the party s left wing.",
        "A growing conflict over voting rights and ballot access is playing out in Georgia, where civil rights activists are trading accusations with Republican elected officials and where the stakes have risen considerably with the state\u2019s new status as a closely watched battleground. Activists said this month that as many as 100, 000 Georgia applications have not been processed. One of the state\u2019s largest counties offered only one site, prompting waits for many people at the polls last week. And the state\u2019s top election official has refused to extend deadlines in counties hardest hit by Hurricane Matthew.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 People here are trying to comprehend what has happened over these past few months, how to process a delirious and wholly unfamiliar confluence. A visitor flying in might hear a Southwest flight attendant, minutes before takeoff, declare the plane is bound for \u201cCleveland, the land of champions. \u201d One might see along Prospect Avenue the construction of a television stage for a national NBA pregame show, and another one around the corner for a national MLB pregame show.",
        "Insurers are raising the 2017 premiums for a popular and significant group of health plans sold through HealthCare. gov by an average of 25 percent, more than triple the percentage increase of this year\u2019s plans, according to new government figures. The steep increase in rates serves broadly to confirm what has become evident piecemeal in recent months: Prompted by a burden of unexpectedly sick Affordable Care Act customers, some insurers are dropping out while many remaining companies are struggling to cover their costs.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s closing argument has been to blame his fall on the dishonest, corrupt, horrible, poisonous and biased media. Trump is correct that there has been something wrong with the coverage. But the problem is the media didn\u2019t show bias against Trump earlier and more often. I\u2019m not talking about partisan bias, but a healthy and necessary journalistic bias against authoritarianism. Press treatment of Trump has, gradually and belatedly, become much tougher. But we in the media made Trump possible in the first place and enjoyed the entertainment (and ratings) he provided for far too long.",
        "Though Republican prospects are not quite dead, the autopsy has already begun. Which is probably not a good idea, even in metaphor. But the best of the anticipatory autopsies so far comes from Matthew Continetti writing in National Review. In \u201cCrisis of the Conservative Intellectual,\u201d Continetti traces a struggle between intellectual conservatives (think William F. Buckley Jr. and George F. Will) and the new right (think Sarah Palin and Pat Buchanan) over the meaning of the movement. In Continetti\u2019s telling, National Review conservatives \u2014 \u201celitist, pessimistic, grimly witty, and academic\u201d \u2014 had depth but lacked power.",
        "Donald Trump looks likely to get a whupping (or, to use his preferred Yiddishism, schlonging) in a few weeks. Forecasts suggest many of his will as well. No doubt, should this expected defeat come to pass, Republican leadership will try to regroup and figure out what went wrong.",
        "Not enough has been made of two obvious facts: Hillary Clinton, if she wins, will be the first woman elected to the White House. And it will have been the votes of women who put her there. Think, for a moment, about what a remarkable milestone that would be. Consider what it would say about the long and difficult struggle to make the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of freedom and equality encompass all Americans. The first 43 presidents were all members of a privileged minority group \u2014 white males.",
        "Pearl and Harry Cohen, a. k. a. my parents, did not believe in transparency. When a big decision had to be made regarding my sister and me, my parents retreated to their bedroom and issued their pronouncement the next morning. They spoke as one. There was no way to divide them. As a child, I could have used WikiLeaks. Now WikiLeaks is all over the place, a veritable downpour of the once secret, both consequential and trivial \u201d more the latter than the former, it seems.",
        "CHARLOTTESVILLE \u2014 \u201cJackie,\u201d the University of Virginia student who described a brutal gang rape in a Rolling Stone magazine article, said that she felt pressured to cooperate with the article\u2019s reporter and expressed concerns about the article\u2019s veracity to friends and school administrators in the days before it was published. Jurors heard from Jackie in a recorded deposition played in a federal courtroom here Monday, her first public remarks since shortly after Rolling Stone published her allegations of a fraternity gang rape nearly two years ago.",
        "The Pentagon is reviewing how to resolve the cases of thousands of Army National Guard members who received enlistment bonuses of at least $15, 000, only to be told later that the money wasn\u2019t really theirs and must be repaid. About 10, 500 members of the California Army National Guard could be affected, said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. The military offered similar bonuses to Guard members in other parts of the country but hasn\u2019t disclosed how many. Davis said Monday that senior Pentagon leaders are \u201clooking very closely at this matter.",
        "For 10 years, the government waged a war against pharmaceutical companies that hardly anyone knows: wholesale distributors of prescription narcotics that ship drugs from manufacturers to consumers. The Drug Enforcement Administration targeted these middlemen for a simple reason. If the agency could force the companies to police their own drug shipments, it could keep millions of pills out of the hands of abusers and dealers. That would be much more effective than fighting \u201cdiversion\u201d of legal painkillers at each drugstore and pain clinic.",
        "BROOKLYN \u2014 One is a daily carnival watched over by the counterterrorism squad, bulky toughs in plainclothes and a cast of protesters bellowing at one another. The other is a quiet bit of sidewalk in front of a nondescript surrounded by $3 million condos and a slew of government offices. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton set up their national campaign headquarters seven miles from each other. The journey from a showman\u2019s gleaming showplace to a tired old building where Brooklynites have their bloodwork done is a mere ride on the No. 5 Lexington Avenue Express.",
        "RICHMOND \u2014 Republican Donald Trump, never short on campaign shockers, pulled one off Saturday simply by setting foot in Virginia. Trump\u2019s rally in Virginia Beach, part of a renewed push here that included a $2 million television ad buy, flabbergasted political analysts and GOP strategists who have considered the swing state off the table for months. Trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton by double digits in the latest Virginia polls, Trump will dispatch key surrogates \u2014 his children \u2014 for a series of visits to Northern Virginia this week.",
        "Just before midnight Saturday, Tom Hanks put on a denim shirt, a goatee and a red \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\u201d hat, and in six minutes pulled off the best political sketch of the year \u2014 and it didn\u2019t even feature Kate McKinnon or Alec Baldwin as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has staged its \u201cBlack Jeopardy\u201d sketch a few times before, pitting its African American cast members against white guest hosts who can\u2019t overcome their own whiteness to answer clues about black culture and jargon.",
        "Tesla, the upstart automaker that once landed Consumer Reports\u2019 performance rating, has now achieved a far less impressive feat, with a ranking from the reviewer that labels it one the least reliable car companies in America. The Consumer Reports\u2019 ranking, released Monday, places Tesla at no. 25 of 29 for reliability, with reviewers saying the automaker\u2019s new Model X SUV \u201dhas been plagued with malfunctions,\u201d including with the \u201d doors\u201d that have become its signature.",
        "Gordon Hamilton, a prominent climate scientist who studied Earth\u2019s melting ice sheets, died Saturday when his snowmobile went into a crevasse in Antarctica, according to the National Science Foundation. He was 50. Hamilton was a researcher with the U. S. Antarctic Program studying the stability of the ice shelves near McMurdo Station, a research center on Ross Island, 2, 500 miles south of New Zealand. He and his team were camped in a area known as the McMurdo shear zone, where the Ross and McMurdo ice shelves meet.",
        "Late Friday afternoon on Dec. 4, 2014, Stephen Schroeder was waiting to board his packed flight from Philadelphia to Las Vegas for a much anticipated long weekend with his son when his cellphone rang. On the line was an unexpected caller: his doctor, reporting test results sooner than Schroeder had expected. Listening intently, Schroeder was flooded with disbelief as he struggled to comprehend what he was hearing. Using the lip of a trash can as a writing surface, he scribbled notes on the back of his boarding pass, making the doctor spell out each unfamiliar word.",
        "Kobani, Ayn al Arab, Syria \u2014 February 2015. (Emilien ) Photographer Emilien Urbano\u2019s project \u201cWar of a Forgotten Nation\u201d takes us on a visceral, sometimes visually poetic, journey inside the war against the Islamic State. Urbano began the project in August 2014, just two months after Islamic State insurgents staged a surprise takeover of Mosul, one of Iraq\u2019s biggest and most strategically located cities. Urbano\u2019s project follows mostly Kurdish factions battling against the Islamic State and sometimes also against Turkish forces.",
        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has effectively shut down his fundraising operation for the rest of the campaign, a highly unusual move that deals another serious blow to the GOP\u2019s effort to finance its operation before Election Day. Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s national finance chairman, said in an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday that Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee between the party and the campaign, held its last formal fundraiser on Oct. 19. The luncheon was in Las Vegas on the day of the final presidential debate. \u201dWe\u2019ve kind of wound down,\u201d Mnuchin said.",
        "On the day the news broke that Hillary Clinton had used a private email account as secretary of state, the man who would soon be named to chair her presidential campaign fired off a note of distress, venting frustration about some of Clinton\u2019s closest aides. \u201cSpeaking of transparency, our friends Kendall, Cheryl and Phillipe sure weren\u2019t forthcoming on the facts here,\u201d John Podesta complained in the March 2015 note, referring to Clinton\u2019s personal lawyer, David Kendall, as well as former State Department staffers Cheryl Mills and Philippe Reines. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they get this stuff out like 18 months ago?",
        "LOUISBURG, N. C. \u2014 Two weeks from Election Day, a number of battleground states are still fighting over voting laws and whether voters have been adequately informed about an array of changing and sometimes complex rules. An unprecedented number of states have put stricter election laws in place since the last presidential race. And in several cases, those laws were overturned by the courts or are still caught up in litigation, creating the potential for widespread confusion. In some states, such as North Carolina, the rules in place during the primary races have changed for the general election.",
        "For many, many years, scholars have wondered whether William Shakespeare\u2019s plays were actually written by Shakespeare, or at least if they were written solely by the man we now colloquially refer to as the Bard. Although the arguments about his authorship have raged for two centuries, his plays have been printed and reprinted and reprinted again, bearing his name. Now, for the first time and with a bit of help from computers and big data, the Oxford University Press will add Christopher Marlowe as a in all three \u201cHenry VI\u201d plays (Parts 1, 2 and 3)."
