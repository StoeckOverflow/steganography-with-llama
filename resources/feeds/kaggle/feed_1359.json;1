        "Take the baby boomers. Please. The idealists of the 1960s have come a long way from Woodstock. After a century of mismanaging the country, they have produced Donald Trump, who with his narcissistic and uncompromising style is a bright orange symbol of what went wrong with the massive generation. And polls show that the boomers are the biggest source of support for Trump.",
        "When the United States fights its wars in the Middle East, it has a nasty habit of recruiting local forces as proxies and then jettisoning them when the going gets tough or regional politics intervene. This pattern of \u201cseduction and abandonment\u201d is one of our least endearing characteristics. It\u2019s one reason the United States is mistrusted in the Middle East. We don\u2019t stick by the people who take risks on our behalf in Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon and elsewhere.",
        "My opening question for Fred Hochberg was really quite simple: \u201cOkay. You\u2019re the chairman of the Bank. What on earth is that?\u201d In the 12th episode of \u201cCape Up,\u201d Hochberg explains that the federal bank does two things. First, it provides a federal guarantee for financing to companies of all sizes operating in markets where \u201ccredit isn\u2019t available\u201d from banks. Second, the bank helps to create \u201ca level playing field\u201d for U. S.",
        "WHAT HAPPENED last Friday on the Internet might be remembered as the Day of the Zombie Baby Monitors. Tens of millions of electronic devices that are online, such as baby monitors, security webcams and digital video recorders, all of them infected with malware, were given a mysterious order to attack, and they obeyed, sending out mindless waves of traffic. The target was Dyn, a New Hampshire company that provides domain name services, allowing people to reach the correct website.",
        "Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality. It\u2019s time for recombobulation, after this presidential campaign, which you have enjoyed to the hilt and don\u2019t deny it. Never been anything like it. The hulking duke of darkness, the nasty lady in white. Goodbye, high school civics. Hello, Shakespeare. But now we must deal with serious business, such as the foolishness of the Smithsonian wanting to spend $300, 000 to preserve Dorothy\u2019s slippers from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz. \u201d (No, no, no, no, no. They\u2019re only shoes, folks.",
        "The New York Giants have released kicker Josh Brown, the team announced Tuesday. Brown has been engulfed by controversy over his admissions of domestic violence involving his former wife, Molly Brown, and the handling of his case by the NFL and the team. The Giants\u2019 previous actions in the matter were \u201cmisguided,\u201d John Mara said in a written statement Tuesday in which the Giants announced their decision to sever their ties with the kicker. \u201cWe believed we did the right thing at every juncture in our relationship with Josh,\u201d Mara said.",
        "The skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs has been noticeably absent from discussion in the presidential debates \u2014 even as bipartisan anger about price gouging has united Congress. But the trade group for the pharmaceutical industry, PhRMA, is gearing up to defend drug prices after the election, seeking an additional $100 million in annual dues from its members, according to a report from Politico. Politico reported Tuesday that the new dues will boost the lobbying group\u2019s budget by 50 percent, giving it more than $300 million to draw on.",
        "PARIS \u2014 As thousands of Iraqi troops slowly encircle the city of Mosul, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter met here Tuesday with key coalition members, suggesting that the battle for the Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital in northern Syria could soon begin. Carter spoke alongside French Defense Minister Le Drian, discussing what will come after the last Islamic State fighters are purged from Mosul and the coalition sets its sights on Raqqa, Syria. Carter said the U. S. coalition is helping to build the local force, including a contingent of Arab fighters, that will be used to enter Raqqa.",
        "Kaiser Health News On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has sharply criticized the industry, accusing pharmaceutical companies of profiteering and vowing to control skyrocketing costs. But Clinton\u2019s tone was often more conciliatory before her presidential campaign when she addressed medical companies and trade groups as part of her brief but lucrative career delivering speeches for pay. Elements of the speeches, some of which were delivered behind closed doors, were revealed in a hacked email that WikiLeaks made public in recent weeks.",
        "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a data point that better captures the weirdness of this presidential election cycle than the following: According to the Federal Election Commission filings, Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has spent $1. 8 million on polling from June 2015 through September of this year (the most recent month for which data are available). The report also lists $3. 2 million spent on hats. Trump has probably spent more on hats than he has spent on direct mail.",
        "On the Tuesday two weeks before Election Day, Jason Miller, the senior communications adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, had a poll from Rasmussen Reports highlighted on his Twitter account. Miller tweeted it Monday and then pinned it (in Twitter parlance) ensuring that any visitor to his Twitter page would see the poll results first. \u201dRasmussen: TRUMP,\u201d it said. But the preview for the link said something different: \u201dHillary Clinton has slipped one point ahead.\u201d That\u2019s because the traditionally Rasmussen\u2019s daily tracking poll shifted between Monday and Tuesday, and Miller\u2019s tweet was suddenly out of date.",
        "Before he moved to Washington a few years ago, to a new apartment building in a gentrifying hot spot just north of Logan Circle, Eric Rosecrants owned a house in Florida that was huge compared with his current digs. Yet the house, near Orlando, was only 1, 200 square feet. His boyfriend, Jonathan Pinkerton, with whom he lives in the District, also gave up relatively spacious quarters in Florida \u2014 890 square feet \u2014 when the two relocated to the nation\u2019s capital, to a \u201c \u201d in a building called the Harper.",
        "The abdominal pains, which felt like waves of menstrual cramps, got worse throughout the day. Finally, Stephanie Jaegers decided she had to go to the hospital. She was having some back pain, too, and it hurt when she urinated, so Jaeger thought she might have kidney stones. When she and her husband got to the hospital, staff asked her if she was pregnant. No, she said. At 37, the mother of two boys and a girl was done having babies. Baby clothes were donated, and the car seat and crib were stowed away in the attic.",
        "Oral cancer is on the rise in American men, with health insurance claims for the condition jumping 61 percent from 2011 to 2015, according to a new analysis. The most dramatic increases were in throat cancer and tongue cancer, and the data show that claims were nearly three times as common in men as in women during that same period with a split of 74 percent to 26 percent.",
        "Lamar took his very first steps next to a barbwire fence. The fence, just outside of his mother\u2019s tent, is the same fence known by nearly 60, 000 migrants trapped in Greece as another hurdle in their long journey deeper into Europe. Before the Idomeni camp in Greece was cleared in May, it was on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe and a way station for as many as 14, 000 desperate asylum seekers like Lamar\u2019s mother, Shaimaa. Shaimaa, 26, and her son Lamar.",
        "A growing number of prominent Republican women are worried that as members of their party step up to defend Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault, they are causing irreparable damage to the GOP\u2019s deteriorating relationship with female voters. Trump has faced questions throughout his campaign about his crass comments about women, but concern escalated this month following the release of a 2005 video in which Trump boasted that he had sexually assaulted women and subsequent allegations by 11 women that Trump had inappropriately touched or kissed them.",
        "CHARLOTTE \u2014 Donald Trump on Wednesday pledged what he called a \u201cnew deal for black America\u201d as he attempted to make late inroads with a voting bloc that polling shows favors Democrat Hillary Clinton by a vast margin. \u201cI will be your greatest champion,\u201d Trump said during an campaign rally here. \u201cI will never ever take the African American community for granted. Never, ever.",
        "SOUTH JORDAN, Utah \u2014 Jason Chaffetz, the Utah congressman wrapping up his first term atop the powerful House Oversight Committee, unendorsed Donald Trump weeks ago. That freed him up to prepare for something else: spending years, come January, probing the record of a President Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s a environment,\u201d the Republican said in an interview in Salt Lake City\u2019s suburbs. \u201cEven before we get to Day One, we\u2019ve got two years\u2019 worth of material already lined up. She has four years of history at the State Department, and it ain\u2019t good.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Nearly nine months after Zika was declared a global health emergency, the virus has infected at least 650, 000 people in Latin America and the Caribbean, including tens of thousands of expectant mothers. But to the great bewilderment of scientists, the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil. Instead, Zika has left a puzzling and distinctly uneven pattern of damage across the Americas. According to the latest U. N.",
        "More than 1 in 4 of the nation\u2019s teachers are considered chronically absent from school, according to federal data, missing the equivalent of more than two weeks of classes each academic year in what some districts say has become an educational crisis. The U. S. Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights estimated this summer that 27 percent of the nation\u2019s teachers are out of school for more than 10 days of regular classes \u2014 some missing far more than 10 days \u2014 based on numbers from the nation\u2019s school districts.",
        "When told that the New England transcendentalist Margaret Fuller had grandly declared \u201cI accept the universe,\u201d the Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle dryly remarked: \u201cShe\u2019d better. \u201d Much ink and indignation has been spilled concerning whether Donald (\u201cI am much more humble than you would understand\u201d) Trump will \u201caccept\u201d the election\u2019s outcome.",
        "McLEAN It is a message Democrats will be sending in suburban precincts all over the United States during the 2016 campaign\u2019s final days: Defeating Donald Trump isn\u2019t enough. Fully rejecting Trumpism also means routing Republican House and Senate candidates who showed any ambivalence in pushing back against a nominee that so many upscale voters regard with horror. Rudra Kapila, a Democratic organizer, explained the mission to a group of volunteers who filled a cheerful suburban home here just outside of Washington on Tuesday night to work a party phone bank.",
        "It\u2019s apt that Donald Trump\u2019s new hotel in Washington, which he dedicated at a Wednesday, is at the Old Post Office. Just 13 days before the election, Trump is mailing it in. Polls suggest he\u2019s doomed, fellow Republicans are treating him like cholera, and even his allies say it would take a miracle to prevail.",
        "The results are in. These are the quotes that readers think won the election: \u201cGrab them by the p \u2014 y. \u201d \u2014 Donald Trump \u201cBasket of deplorables. \u201d \u2014 Hillary Clinton \u201cWhen they go low, we go high. \u201d \u2014 Michelle Obama So if that\u2019s how we\u2019ll remember this past year and a half, what does each quote say about 2016? Trump\u2019s winning quote edged out his other comments and catchphrases by no small margin, getting 53 percent of the vote in a ( ) reader poll.",
        "LOS ANGELES You\u2019d think Proposition 62, a referendum to abolish California\u2019s death penalty and replace it with life without parole, including for the 749 current occupants of death row, would win easily on Nov. 8. Democrats dominate this state; their 2016 national platform advocated an end to capital punishment. Former president Jimmy Carter, icon Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) the state\u2019s major labor unions and 38 newspaper editorial boards are urging a \u201cyes\u201d vote.",
        "Gerald S. Rose, a retired U. S. Army colonel and foreign service officer, lives in Falls Church. A significant segment of Americans sees this nation in decline, if not free fall. Never has the United States been in such bad shape, they say, and it is getting worse. Nothing could be further from the truth. I would ask today\u2019s naysayers to identify a period in our recent history when the nation was in better shape \u2014 economically, socially or in any other way than now.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 Russia canceled a request to refuel a flotilla of its warships at a Spanish port Wednesday, according to Russian media and other news reports. The move came among mounting criticism leveled at Madrid from NATO\u2019s secretary general and Britain\u2019s defense minister. The Russian battle group, containing cruisers, submarine hunting warships and Russia\u2019s lone aircraft carrier \u2014 the Admiral Kuznetsov \u2014 were set to refuel in Ceuta, a port situated in north Africa near the Strait of Gibraltar, before heading to the Mediterranean Sea.",
        "Two senators asked Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch Wednesday to explain a sharp drop in the number of enforcement actions against large pharmaceutical distributors and others by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( .) and Sen. Ron Wyden ( .) requested a wide variety of information about cases brought by DEA\u2019s Diversion Control Division in the wake of a Washington Post investigation published over the weekend.

        "In the wake of the news that Donald Trump had stopped doing formal, major donor fundraising events for the Republican Party as of, well, now, I reached out to Lisa Spies, a prominent Republican fundraiser, to gauge the impact of that decision. (How hardcore is Lisa about fundraising? Her email signature included a quote from Republican boss Mark Hanna: \u201cThere are two things that are important in politics. The first is money, and I can\u2019t remember what the second one is. \u201d) Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.",
        "Maybe it was inevitable that 2016 would come to this: With two weeks to go in the presidential campaign, the Republican nominee and the Democratic vice president are talking openly about getting into a fight. Four days after Vice President Biden first raised that hypothetical when talking about Donald Trump\u2019s comments about women, Trump responded in kind Tuesday night in Tallahassee. \u201cDid you see where Biden wants to take me to the back of the barn? Me. He wants it. I\u2019d love that. I\u2019d love that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s Mr. Tough Guy. You know when he\u2019s Mr."
