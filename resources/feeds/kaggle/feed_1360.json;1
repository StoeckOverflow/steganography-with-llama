The request, from an attorney in the . general counsel\u2019s office in late 2014, suggested that it would be helpful to the university if \u201cJackie\u201d were to issue a public statement about her interactions with .",
        "Students who report being sexually assaulted at Brigham Young University will no longer face the possibility of punishment for honor code violations, such as drinking or extramarital sex. The nation\u2019s preeminent Mormon university announced the new amnesty policy on Wednesday, acceding to a demand from many activists who saw peril for the victims of sexual assault at the conservative religious institution in Utah. \u201cOur top priority is the safety and of our students. This is particularly true for those who have been the victims of sexual assault,\u201d the university\u2019s president Kevin J.",
        "The story of how \u201cPatient Zero\u201d and AIDS arrived in New York in 1979 and triggered the epidemic in North America has been told so many times in so many different ways that for many people it\u2019s become an accepted truth of our modern history. It begins with a single man, a young flight attendant named Gaetan Dugas, who presumably became infected abroad and then unwittingly gave it to some of his sexual partners.",
        "The Pentagon has secretly expanded its global network of drone bases to North Africa, deploying unmanned aircraft and U. S. military personnel to a facility in Tunisia to conduct spy missions in neighboring Libya.

S. air offensive against an Islamic State stronghold in neighboring Libya.",

She said she and Cook had originally contacted each other via Facebook and gotten together four or five times, always in public. But then, after studying with him at a college library, they went to his apartment near the campus where he started kissing her, at first lightly, then forcefully. She says she told him to stop several times, the Wisconsin State Journal said, citing a police report, until he sexually assaulted her repeatedly.",
        "There is no guiding force in Scott F. Smith\u2018s series, \u201cPaper,\u201d except instinct. Beginning with a pristine sheet, Smith makes a series of clean slices. It\u2019s an engaging process of delicate manipulations: pulling the paper, carving it, and modulating light to reveal its inner corridors. In addition to his studio lighting setup, Smith has a collection of tiny flashlights that he uses to target nooks in his pieces. He uses them to experiment on various types of paper. Smith is fascinated with the idea of using simple materials as a conduit for expressing different qualities of light.",
        "When the Justice Department announced two months ago that it wanted to end the use of private prisons, Cibola County Correctional Center was exactly the kind of facility that officials desired to shut down. After a history of questionable deaths and substandard medical care, the New Mexico facility lost its contract. In recent weeks, it was emptied of inmates. But the vacancies won\u2019t last for long.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the 2016 presidential election is \u201crigged\u201d against him has become a central part of his closing argument to voters in the final days of the campaign, as the GOP nominee insists that a growing range of \u201ccorrupt\u201d public institutions are to blame for his sharply narrowing path the White House. As he heads into a potential loss on Nov. 8, Trump has expanded the scale and scope of his accusations to include Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the media, establishment leaders from both parties and unidentified \u201cglobal financial powers.",
        "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The armed occupation of Oregon\u2019s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge spanned 41 freezing cold days in January and February. The trial for the standoff\u2019s leader, Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan and five others took six weeks. And the verdict came in just five days: all defendants were found not guilty of federal conspiracy charges. It was the grand finale of a federal trial that played out like a circus. The trial often saw the courtroom packed with more than 100 people \u2014 jurors, attorneys, supporters, journalists \u2014 and another room four floors up packed with even more.",

If you told me two years ago that the Supreme Court was going to have to approve whether I could use the school restroom, I would have thought you were joking. In the fall of 2014, I began my sophomore year at Gloucester High School in Virginia. At the end of the previous school year, after years of stress and anxiety, I had finally come out to my family as transgender.",
        "Stop celebrating, Democrats. Yes, it looks likely that your party will soon have control of the White House and Senate and, at the very least, win the popular vote in House elections, if not actually a majority of House seats. And, yes, it looks as if the Republican Party is paralyzed with dysfunction, trapped in a civil war about the fundamental mission, values and tone of the party. The GOP base is drifting further and further into crazyland, thanks to its many influential conspiracy theorists and wielding microphones and muskets.",
        "Last week, the U. N.\u2019s premier cultural agency, UNESCO, approved a resolution viciously condemning Israel (referred to as \u201cthe Occupying Power\u201d) for various alleged trespasses and violations of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Except that the resolution never uses that term for Judaism\u2019s holiest shrine. It refers to and treats it as an exclusively Muslim site, a deliberate attempt to eradicate its connection \u2014 let alone its centrality \u2014 to the Jewish people and Jewish history.",
        "If Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign were one of his beauty pageants, instead of a \u201cMiss Congeniality\u201d consolation prize there would have to be a \u201cMr. or Ms. Deplorable. \u201d According to my score card, the winner is Rudy Giuliani. Trump is the master of ceremonies, so he\u2019s ineligible. The competition among his enablers \u2014 to see who can most thoroughly squander credibility and reputation \u2014 has been fierce. There are so many worthy candidates for the Deplorable sash that it\u2019s a shame only one aide or surrogate can win.",
        "ELECTION DAY is still more than a week away, but for some Republicans it is not too soon to begin plotting the next war against Hillary Clinton if she wins the presidency. Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) raised the prospect of an indefinite Republican blockade around the vacant Supreme Court seat. Irresponsibly, Senate Republicans have refused to even hold hearings on President Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the seat of Antonin Scalia, who died in February. Now Mr. Cruz seems to be suggesting that this willful dysfunction be carried into the new Congress and presidency.",
        "The 25th anniversary of Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court has featured testimonials from his supporters, a symposium on his jurisprudence and tributes from conservative legal scholars about his influence on the court. But Thursday brought an unwelcome echo of the sexual harassment allegations that almost derailed his 1991 nomination: An Alaska lawyer told the National Law Journal that Thomas groped her at a dinner party in 1999, when she was a young Truman Foundation scholar in Washington. Through a court spokeswoman, Thomas told the publication: \u201cThis claim is preposterous and it never happened.",

Under the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s new rules, consumers may forbid Internet providers from sharing sensitive personal information, such as app and browsing histories, mobile location data and other information generated while using the Internet.

        "CHARLOTTESVILLE \u2014 In the weeks before Rolling Stone magazine published a sensational article about sexual assault at the University of Virginia in November 2014, Dean of Students Allen Groves wrote a message to administrators questioning the magazine\u2019s bias. \u201cIn my opinion, Rolling Stone has not been objective in recent years,\u201d Groves wrote, noting that it \u201cleads me to believe this is a hatchet job. \u201d Groves testified this week in federal court as part of a $7. 5 million defamation lawsuit filed by former .",
        "The callers in India, claiming to be officials with the Internal Revenue Service or immigration services, would present those who answered the phone with an ultimatum.
