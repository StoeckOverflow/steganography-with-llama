        "A jury\u2019s stunning rejection of the government\u2019s case against seven people charged in connection with this year\u2019s armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon has reignited the combustible debate in America over the federal government\u2019s authority and its land use policies in the West. While land rights and activists greeted the jury\u2019s decision as a victory for American liberty, others called it a terrifying invitation for armed protesters to occupy federal land and buildings with impunity, potentially putting federal workers at risk.",
        "POLITICAL TENSION is running high in the United States, extraordinarily so, we\u2019d say. And so it behooves everyone in a position of official responsibility to do everything he or she possibly can to help maintain stability \u2014 while avoiding all avoidable provocations \u2014 until the bitter competition between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump runs its ugly course on Nov. 8. That is the context for Friday\u2019s announcement by James B. Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that his agency is again looking into Ms.",
        "One more week, give or take. It seems nearly impossible that an election season that began approximately four years ago is nearing its end. After almost two years of speeches, rallies and raunch, this presidential campaign has become just another sound in the white noise of life. Like \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d or perdition, it seemed it never would end. Ever. Now, suddenly, only days remain before we vote. Wait, no, I\u2019m not ready!

        "I have spent much of my weekends of late at gatherings in houses of worship discussing some aspect of the presidential election. Never has Episcopal rector Phillips Brooks\u2019s prayer \u201cOpen wide the eyes of my soul that I may see good in all things\u201d been more tested. This election season has brought out the worst. The meanness and outrageous lies are revolting, a far cry from Brooks\u2019s declaration to \u201clive so honestly and fearlessly that no outward failure can dishearten . . . or take away the joy of conscious integrity.",

        "Last month, the man who\u2019s tried to turn vote prediction into a science predicted a Trump win. Allan J. Lichtman, distinguished professor of history at American University, said Democrats would not be able to hold on to the White House. In the intervening weeks, the campaign was rocked by a series of events.

What I\u2019m not sure about, however, is how much I\u2019ll love the control bar once it\u2019s no longer in front of me.

The Lady\u2019s previous albums each came with their share of vanilla lumps, but usually with cherries on top, too \u2014 maraschino megahits to distract us from the fact that pop\u2019s leading wild thing makes lots of blah music. To our retinas, she was never dull. Lady Gaga\u2019s flamboyance turned heads, but it also radiated deeper messages about freedom, affirmation and empowerment.",

        "Most breaking news stories, especially ones based on sources, tend to be contradictory, confusing or incomplete.

Actually, we already live in that world, especially if you\u2019re a public figure or talking to one, as WikiLeaks has shown by its steady release of hacked emails during the presidential campaign. During the primary race, it published emails of Democratic National Committee officials, and this month it has busied itself with broadcasting those of top Democrats working inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.",
        "Voters will decide between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at a moment when Americans seem primed for a message of national renewal. Two thirds of Americans said the country has \u201cpretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track\u201d in a CBS News poll this month, and Gallup found an even larger 7 in 10 dissatisfied with the way things are going. Trump supporters have pointed to these numbers to bolster the theory that this is a change election, with conditions favoring their candidate.

        "Last year, a group of San Diego realtors had an idea. What if they threw a \u201cbetter block\u201d party in a Latino neighborhood called Barrio Logan? Maybe, they thought, it would create a buzz about the neighborhood. Maybe it would get residents outside, walking around and talking to their neighbors.
