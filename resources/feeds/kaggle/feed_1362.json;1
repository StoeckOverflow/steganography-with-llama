        "Lisa McCombs, a decorated Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, claims she\u2019d never had any trouble flying with her service dog, a Labrador retriever named Jake. That changed one year ago, when she was barred from boarding a regional American Airlines flight with Jake, who was wearing his service vest and was properly documented at the time, according to a federal lawsuit. McCombs suffers from PTSD and relies on her dog to calm her anxiety and panic before it overwhelms her.",

Diepenbrock recorded the footage in after he had been involved in a motorcycle crash near the Carolina border. Diepenbrock was injured, but help had not arrived. So Diepenbrock, whose friend was killed in the incident, began to record. \u201cHey everybody,\u201d he says in the video. \u201cI f \u2014 \u2014 up, that\u2019s all I can really say.

        "Midway into his speech, the crowd suddenly grew restless, so Donald Trump paused. An increasing number of people began pointing at a person to Trump\u2019s right. Soon, hundreds of people who had gathered for his Wednesday evening campaign rally in Kinston, N. C. were frantically waving their \u201cTrump Pence\u201d signs in that direction. Trump glanced at who his supporters were singling out: A black man wearing a suit jacket and sunglasses. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, leave him alone,\u201d Trump said, at first seemed dismissive of what he saw. He quickly pivoted. \u201cWe have a protester,\u201d Trump declared. The crowd booed.",

        "With the annual period for plans on the health law\u2019s marketplaces starting Nov. 1, many consumers are worried about rising premiums, shrinking provider networks and the departure of major insurers such as UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Humana from many exchanges. The impact on coverage will vary, but the shifting landscape means that it\u2019s more important than ever for consumers to carefully evaluate the plans that are available in their area and choose the best one for their needs. There are several elements to factor into that decision. It\u2019s crucial to log into the marketplace and review plan details.",
        "The first time it happened, she said, she was 5 years old. Her mother was in the hospital \u2014 having just given birth to the girl\u2019s newest sibling \u2014 when her father slipped into her bedroom and raped her, starting a cycle of sexual, physical and emotional abuse, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Her father tied her up and locked her in an old chicken coop \u2014 or sometimes a small storage box \u2014 for days at a time, and surrounded her with barbed wire to keep her from attempting an escape.",
        "During a recent family dinner, I watched in utter fascination as my boys shoveled down their meals at record speed. I then realized I was beginning to shovel, too. It was like NASCAR at our dinner table, a race to see who could clear their plate the fastest. We had forgotten to chew. Did we even taste our dinners? When I paused to slow us down, my boys asked why the speed we eat matters.",
        "Think \u201cCaribbean,\u201d and images of palm trees, aquamarine seas and fruity drinks with umbrellas typically come to mind. But scratch the surface, and you\u2019ll find distinctly different vibes, landscapes, weather and attractions defining the region\u2019s more than 7, 000 individual islands. Consider that Trinidad is nearly 1, 500 miles south of Grand Bahama Island, which is farther than the distance between Boston and Miami. Six official languages, plus dozens of local ones, are spoken across the Caribbean. Cuba is the size of Tennessee, while the island of Saba is just five square miles.",

One official said the total number of emails recovered in the Weiner investigation is close to 650, 000 \u2014 though that reflects many emails that are not in any way relevant to the Clinton investigation.",
        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is redirecting his attention to traditionally Democratic states in the final days of the 2016 campaign in an urgent attempt to expand what for weeks has been an increasingly narrow path to victory. Following FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s surprise announcement Friday that the agency would once again examine emails related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state, Trump and his advisers see a fresh opportunity to make gains in states that most public polls have shown as out of reach.",

        "There are eight days left before Americans will choose whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States. And, although October \u2014 and its surprises \u2014 have become cliche in politics at this point, it\u2019s hard to remember a final month of a presidential campaign that has contained so many twists and turns. So, where, exactly, are we? Here\u2019s what (I think) we know. 1. The electoral map (still) favors Clinton (by a lot) Trump is making campaign stops in New Mexico on Sunday and Michigan on Monday.",

        "ROME \u2014 A strong earthquake that shook Italy on Sunday morning took a heavy toll on historic churches and other landmark buildings, some dating back to the Middle Ages. No deaths were reported and there were only \u201ctens\u201d of injuries, but the physical damage was extensive. In Preci, the walls of a hillside cemetery came crashing down on top of the Abbey of St. Euticius, founded in the 5th century by a group of Syrian monks and hermits and now crushed under the weight of its own burial ground.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Nate Silver is on the downtown 1 train. Possibly because he looks like a (modestly) hip math teacher, and hardly looks up from his phone, he goes unrecognized until he reaches the PlayStation Theater in Times Square. There, his name is in lights, and people start to nudge one another and point him out.

S. coalition struck a security complex in the western Yemeni city of Hodeidah late Saturday night, killing at least 43 and injuring scores more, according to Yemeni officials and local news reports.

        "Since the conventions, a key question in the presidential race has been whether Donald Trump could hold together a substantial Republican voting bloc \u2014 and what that bloc might look like. When his poll numbers tanked shortly after the Democratic National Convention (and Trump\u2019s fight with the Gold Star Khan family) it was largely a function of Republicans\u2019 bailing. In more recent national polls, which have shown the margin between Trump and Hillary Clinton all over the map, we could look at how much support Trump got from Republicans as a key factor driving the results.",
        "Vice President Biden said Hillary Clinton has been \u201cbattered\u201d by decades of Republican campaigns to undermine her credibility. But he said that she will have to be \u201cmore open\u201d with the public if she becomes president.

        "LONDON \u2014 The United Kingdom finally received an entertaining American football game Sunday. It ended, however, like many English football matches \u2014 in a draw. The Washington Redskins traded blows with the Cincinnati Bengals in front of 84, 488 at Wembley Stadium, but neither team could deliver the knockout punch in a tie . It marked the 28th tie in franchise history but just Washington\u2019s second since the NFL adopted overtime in 1974. \u201cIf it was going to happen, I guess it\u2019s fitting for this stadium,\u201d rookie linebacker Su\u2019a Cravens said. \u201cI mean, damn.

That question applies not only to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump but also to Scott Adams, the \u201cDilbert\u201d creator who was long seen as a champion of the beleaguered cubicle dweller.

Comey\u2019s disclosure last week that the bureau has resumed its investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server after discovering a new trove of emails.

        "KENT, Ohio \u2014 Hillary Clinton sought Monday to redirect the focus of the presidential race to national security and Donald Trump\u2019s fitness for office after days of damaging uncertainty over a renewed investigation into her email use when she was secretary of state.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s hiring of pollster Tony Fabrizio in May was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation. But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran GOP strategist, who has advised candidates from 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. The Trump campaign\u2019s latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly $767, 000 that Fabrizio\u2019s firm says it is still owed for polling."
