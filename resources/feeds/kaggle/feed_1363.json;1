        "NO ONE SHOULD be happy that the outcome of a U. S. presidential election could be affected, if not determined, by a cryptic letter from the FBI director released 11 days before the vote. But that is our unfortunate situation. So what do we do now? For starters: Take a deep breath. Remember what is important and what is not. And, modifying the Hippocratic oath: Do no further harm. What would that mean? For Republican nominee Donald Trump, it would mean not lying about what has happened. The email affair is not \u201cbigger than Watergate.",
        "William Barr was U. S. attorney general from 1991 to 1993. He is supporting Donald Trump in the presidential election. The continuing refrain from Hillary Clinton supporters and other observers that FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s action was \u201ccontrary\u201d to Justice Department policy is flatly wrong. Given the particular circumstances facing Comey, it is absurd. While I do not agree with everything done and said over the summer in connection with the email investigation, I think that, last week, Comey had no choice but to issue the statement he did.",
        "Beyond the precedent that the Justice Department, particularly the FBI, bends over backward not to interfere in a presidential election, there is yet another precedent, this one established during the Monica Lewinsky investigation: A holder of high office, under pressure from both Congress and the press, can lose his mind. The mind in question belonged to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, who back in the winter of 1997 signaled he had had more than enough of Bill Clinton, sex that wasn\u2019t sex, a dress no longer suitable for a casual date, and other such matters and was quitting.",
        "\u201cHope and change\u201d are so 2008. Now, if anything, it\u2019s just about hope. Donald Trump and his supporters have been insisting for months that this election is a \u201cchange\u201d election. That is, Americans want to throw the bums out \u2014 specifically, the party of the bums occupying the White House \u2014 and usher in a wholly different leadership style that will lead to a wholly different society and economy. \u201cA vote for Hillary is a vote for more of the same,\u201d a recent Trump ad declares.",
        "ZARGAH, Iraq \u2014 Iraqi forces said they reached the eastern outskirts of Mosul on Monday and were preparing to make the first break into the city, which has been held by Islamic State militants for more than two years. Following an push, forces from Iraq\u2019s elite counterterrorism units took positions on the edge of the suburb of Gogjali, an industrial area on the outer limits of Mosul, said Lt. Gen. Abdul Ghani head of the special forces. They had progressed faster than expected during the day, he said.",
        "The NFL\u2019s firm grip on the psyche is based in the fact that it\u2019s the most real, live event on live television. Every game is a story and a chase in which the action and the stakes of a collision are genuine. But lately the NFL has seemed formulaic and lacking in a certain kind of authenticity. It\u2019s no great mystery as to why the NFL\u2019s ratings have been dropping: Viewers don\u2019t especially like the stories they\u2019re watching. The numbers are striking.",
        "This post has been updated. Donald Trump keeps saying that he is going to spend $100 million of his personal funds on his White House bid. \u201cI\u2019ll have over $100 million in my campaign, which means $100 million of people that aren\u2019t giving me money,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee told supporters in Grand Rapids, Mich. on Monday. One of his sons, Eric Trump, went even further, telling Boston Herald Radio on Monday: \u201cSay what you will, my father can\u2019t be bought, he can\u2019t be bribed, he can\u2019t be coerced.",
        "In a letter to FBI Director James B. Comey on Sunday night, outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid ( .) says Comey may have broken the law. And that\u2019s not even the most brazen claim in the letter \u2014 not by a long shot. In the course of arguing that Comey\u2019s disclosure that the FBI is looking into new Hillary Clinton investigation emails may have violated the Hatch Act, Reid slips in an extremely bold claim about the Trump campaign and the Russian government.",
        "By now, depending on your Facebook filter bubble, you\u2019ve probably seen it: a Facebook friend \u201cchecking in\u201d to Standing Rock, N. D. and then a separate post explaining the clever ploy that reads something like this: \u201cThe Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department has been using Facebook to find out who is at Randing Stock in order to target them in attempts to disrupt the prayer camps. SO Water Protecters are calling on EVERYONE to at Randing Stock, ND to overwhelm and confuse them.",
        "For more than two years, Clarise Coleman faithfully attended every track practice and every meet for her son, Chase. Part of it was being a supportive parent, proud that Chase had finally found \u201chis sport. \u201d Coleman loved the camaraderie that the team gave her freshman, even if it meant frequently from their home in Syracuse for meets all around New York state. But as the mother of a nearly nonverbal autistic child, Coleman also knew that she needed to be there for Chase in case he needed help.",
        "Fans of Jen Hatmaker like her because she is, in one word, relatable. The Texas author and speaker writes often about her messy ? family life, confessing in a viral 2013 post to being the worst year mom ever. ? Her homespun approach has garnered her spots on the New York Times bestseller list and an HGTV series alongside husband Brandon and five children. But last week, Hatmaker broke from her evangelical base, telling Religion News Service columnist Jonathan Merritt that she supports marriage and believes LGBT relationships can be holy.",
        "When Susan Benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence, her research took her to places like Kenya and Burma. Lately, she\u2019s been unable to ignore a case study at home in the United States. The American University law professor and Harvard University faculty associate has grappled for months with whether Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it. She has examined speech vefore, but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great.",
        "Frank, a miner boy, on his way home. About 14 years old, Frank has worked in the mine helping his father pick and load for three years. October 1906. (Lewis of Congress) In 1900s America, child labor was not uncommon. You were likely to find children working not just, say, as newspaper deliverers but also in cotton mills and out in the cotton fields, in mines and even on the docks in Baltimore as oyster shuckers.",
        "The Hillary Clinton email controversy has given   Republicans something they badly need in the final days of the election: an opportunity to go on offense and talk about something other than Donald Trump.",
        "KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa. \u2014 Donald Trump swerved back on script Tuesday, showing flashes of a cohesive closing argument in the final stage of a presidential campaign that is tightening with six days left. Joined here by his running mate, Indiana Gov.",
        "DADE CITY, Fla. \u2014 Hillary Clinton and her allies on Tuesday intensified their attacks on Donald Trump\u2019s character and temperament, as they sought to shift scrutiny away from news that the FBI had revived an investigation into her email practices at the State Department. As part of that effort, Clinton made her most direct appeal yet for women to reject Trump\u2019s candidacy during a campaign stop in Dade City, where she recounted a litany of degrading remarks he made about women and referencing the allegations of unwanted sexual advances against him.",
        "WAUKESHA, Wis. \u2014 Donald Trump got the big October surprise. The momentum seems to be going his way. Hillary Clinton is again on the defensive, again over her emails. But in this enclave of white, Republicans, the party\u2019s presidential nominee still faces a barrier that will be difficult to clear. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral choice,\u201d Dick Radder, a Republican, said as he cupped a black coffee outside a Starbucks here Tuesday. \u201cI can\u2019t get there. I can\u2019t get to Trump. I\u2019m a husband and a father.",
        "Filmmaker Joel Gilbert, the conspiracy theorist who believes President Obama has a secret Muslim prayer inscribed on his wedding ring, made a splash in 2012 when he said Obama had plastic surgery to conceal that his real father was labor activist Frank Marshall Davis, who raised his son to lead a communist revolution. Four years later, and just in time for Election Day, Gilbert is back with a new film alleging that Bill Clinton has a son he sired with a black prostitute.",
        "Barton Swaim is author of \u201cThe Speechwriter: A Brief Education in Politics\u201d and a contributing columnist for The Post. It\u2019s true that Donald Trump\u2019s support has little to do with policies. It\u2019s not true, however, that those who support him have no rational or cogent reasons for their preference. They are misguided, in my view, but they aren\u2019t stupid, and we flatter ourselves by assuming their preference for Trump is evidence merely of economic forces they don\u2019t understand.",
        "Eric Chenoweth is of the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy has posed many challenges to U. S. media. In at least one frightening respect, it has failed: News outlets are actively abetting an authoritarian and imperialist foreign power\u2019s attempt to manipulate a U. S. presidential election to aid its favored candidate, Trump, and sanctioning an assault on the individual and civil liberties of all American citizens. There is consensus among U. S.",
        "As the presidential campaigns sink to the challenge of demonstrating that there is no such thing as rock bottom, remember this: When the Clintons decamped from Washington in January 2001, they took some White House furnishings that were public property. They also accepted more than $190, 000 in gifts, including two coffee tables and two chairs, a $7, 375 gratuity from Denise Rich, whose fugitive former husband had been pardoned in President Clinton\u2019s final hours. A Post editorial (\u201cCount the Spoons\u201d) identified \u201cthe Clintons\u2019 defining characteristic: They have no capacity for embarrassment.",
        "\u201cI MEAN, who does that?\u201d That was the question posed by Hillary Clinton at the last presidential debate about Donald Trump\u2019s use of charitable funds to purchase a portrait of himself. We now have a fuller answer to that question. It is someone who uses $264, 631 of foundation funds to renovate a fountain outside one of his luxury hotels. It is someone who pulls a on a public school chess team. It is someone who shamelessly hogs the spotlight at a charity function for sick children without having given a dime. Mr.",
        "In different ways, Lucia \u201cLucy\u201d McBath and DeJuan Patterson are victims of gun violence. And compounding their trauma is the pernicious omnipresence of race. I met them while moderating a panel on \u201crace, violence and access to the American Dream\u201d at the Center for American Progress on Oct. 24. What happened when I had them sit down to record the 13th episode of \u201cCape Up\u201d resulted in the most powerful interview I think I\u2019ve ever done.",
        "Austin Harrouff was being taken into custody when he made the comment, according to court documents. \u201cHelp me,\u201d he said, according to the documents, \u201cI ate something bad . . . \u201d A sergeant who heard Harrouff asked him he ate. \u201cHumans,\u201d Harrouff responded. The details of the conversation were revealed in court documents filed in Martin County, Fla. and obtained by the Palm Beach Post. Harrouff is accused of killing a Florida couple earlier this year, and biting the face of one of the victims, and his case has garnered national attention.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are all but tied in the latest Washington News Tracking Poll, which finds Clinton backers slipping behind in enthusiasm even as the Democrat has an edge in early voting. The tracking poll finds little shift in Clinton\u2019s overall support following news of the FBI\u2019s renewed look at Clinton emails, but strong enthusiasm among her supporters fell behind Trump in combined Saturday and Sunday interviews. By 53 to 43 percent, more Trump supporters say they are \u201dvery enthusiastic\u201d about him, compared with Thursday and Friday when Trump\u2019s edge was negligible (53 percent vs. 51 percent).",
        "Unlike past presidential nominees, Donald Trump has declined to release his complete tax returns, which has fostered fervid speculation about what they might contain \u2014 especially since the New York Times published a few pages from Trump\u2019s 1995 tax documents last month. Those documents suggested that the Republican nominee could have avoided paying taxes on as much as $916 million in income. The question was how he could do so legally.",
        "On the list of words to never, ever say if you\u2019re a male politician \u2014 well, really, a politician of any gender \u2014 the one that Texas\u2019s agriculture commissioner tweeted is most definitely near the top. Especially when used to describe the first female presidential nominee. The Twitter account for Sid Miller, a conservative Republican who is an adviser to Donald Trump, referred to Hillary Clinton as a \u201c \u201d (an obscene term for female genitalia) in a tweet Tuesday afternoon. Miller\u2019s office did not respond to a voice mail seeking comment.",
        "As a brutal year continues in Chicago, the city\u2019s spiking homicide numbers have resulted in grim milestones and headlines. It took only until the end of Labor Day weekend for the city to have more homicides this year than it did in all of last year. There are only two American cities with bigger populations than Chicago \u2014 New York and Los Angeles \u2014 and even if you combine their homicide totals, the tally still lags behind the Windy City.",
        "BAZWAYA, Iraq \u2014 Despite suicide attacks, snipers and roadside bombs, Iraqi commandos swept into the eastern edge of Mosul on Tuesday, setting foot in the city for the first time since it was seized by Islamic State militants more than two years ago. It was a rapid and symbolic incursion into the northern Iraqi city at the heart of the militant group\u2019s \u201ccaliphate. \u201d But bringing the fight into Mosul\u2019s limits does not change the overall challenges facing Iraqi troops trying to oust the militants from their last major stronghold in Iraq.",
        "TEL AVIV \u2014 One of the most divisive trials in Israeli history is taking place in a cramped military courtroom in a peeling mansion in the poor Arab section of Jaffa. It is the trial of a teenage Israeli sergeant, but in many ways it is about the soul of the Israeli army and the young men and women the Jewish state sends to protect its citizens and enforce its almost military occupation."
