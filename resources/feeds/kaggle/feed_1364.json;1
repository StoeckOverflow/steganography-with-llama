        "Venezuelan authorities stopped a Washington Post reporter at the Caracas airport late Monday night and denied him entry, in the latest case of blocking a foreign correspondent from covering the mounting political and economic turmoil in the South American country. Immigration officials told Joshua Partlow, 38, a dual U. S. national, that he lacked a required work visa. Partlow and many other foreign correspondents with . S. passports had routinely visited Venezuela in the past without work visas.",

It\u2019s believed that the tomb at the heart of the church was where the body of Jesus Christ was once laid.

        "MIAMI \u2014 Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton \u201cvery unstable\u201d at a rally in Miami on Wednesday afternoon, a campaign event in which he went hard on the attack against the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cShe\u2019s got bad judgment,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPersonally, I think she\u2019s a very unstable person. \u201d He did not substantiate his claim. The Republican nominee, without presenting specific evidence, also said Clinton \u201cprobably\u201d received a about questions in her debates against him.",
        "President Obama briefly addressed the FBI\u2019s reopened investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices for the first time, saying in an interview posted Wednesday that the agency does not \u201coperate on innuendo\u201d and emphasizing that there is no evidence that the Democratic presidential nominee violated the law. \u201cI do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don\u2019t operate on innuendo, and we don\u2019t operate on incomplete information, and we don\u2019t operate on leaks,\u201d Obama said in the interview with NowThis News, which was filmed Tuesday. \u201cWe operate based on concrete decisions that are made.",

Now he\u2019s 200 miles away in Kabul, sleeping in a tent and living on aid. He is part of a looming humanitarian crisis aid agencies here are struggling to contain.

        "MATTAWAMKEAG, Maine \u2014 The regulars at Bob & Tom\u2019s Gun Shop spend hours here fiddling with firearms, sipping coffee and making small talk \u2014 chatter that now focuses on fighting an initiative that would require universal background checks for nearly all gun purchases in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s honest gun country here,\u201d said Bud McLaughlin of Medway, Maine, who brought his shotgun into the shop, which is filled to the brim with rifles, shotguns, handguns, semiautomatic weapons and boxes of ammunition.",
        "When The Post\u2019s Matea Gold reported this week that the Trump campaign is contesting $767, 000 that its pollster Tony Fabrizio says he is owed, I could feel the Republican consultant\u2019s pain. Fabrizio was just the latest on a long list of people stiffed by Donald Trump. And now you can add one more to that list: me. I want my $49 back. I know, I know. We had all been warned that Trump doesn\u2019t make good on his commitments. Scores of times as businessman and candidate he has refused to pay, or deliver, what he owes.",
        "AS THE 2016 presidential campaign draws to a close, Donald Trump is airing commercials that present him as a change agent who will shake up Washington. Not a mainstream politician, exactly, but nothing to be afraid of, either. This appeal seems to be having some success, as Mr. Trump pulls even with his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, in some national polls and surpasses her in likely voters\u2019 judgment on who is more trustworthy. Ultimately, though, this appeal can succeed only if voters succumb to distractions and ignore or forget Mr. Trump\u2019s record. Allow us to offer a few reminders.",
        "KANSAS CITY, Mo. Will Missouri be the one state next Tuesday that produces an trifecta? And will we ever get to exploring how Donald Trump, who has trafficked with politicians all his life, has gotten away with casting himself as the year\u2019s premier outsider? Missouri was, as recently as 2008, a presidential swing state. This year, it\u2019s Trump Country. But when it comes to control of the U. S. Senate, the state is living up to its old reputation as a decider.",

        "Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin, is a member of the U. S.

        "With the 58th presidential election under the U. S. Constitution now less than a week away, it is clear that the document is not achieving one of its central purposes. James Madison intended it to curb \u201cfactious spirit\u201d \u2014 what we call \u201cpartisanship\u201d \u2014 which he correctly identified as the bane of popular governments, both those that had existed before 1788 and the ones in the 13 newly independent American states.

Less than two weeks after his trip to China and his call for a \u201cseparation\u201d from the United States, the president of the Philippines is for the first time feeling the effects of what seems to be \u2014 to some at least \u2014 a concerted effort to alienate his allies.

        "MURRAY, UTAH \u2014 Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party\u2019s nominee for president, could not believe what was happening. For months he\u2019d argued that the American public\u2019s disgust with the two major parties would cut his path to the White House. He had just watched those candidates disqualify themselves from high office. And he was polling worse than ever \u2014 especially in Utah, where those candidates were toxic. \u201cJames Comey would not have done what he did unless there was something underlying all of this,\u201d Johnson told a crowd of around 100 people at a college auditorium near Salt Lake City.",
        "This presidential election has been downright embarrassing to men. In its closing days, that\u2019s how a lot of men, including Ken Oldham, see the 2016 campaign. So many of its lowest moments involved men and sex: Donald Trump\u2019s vulgar boasts on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video about kissing women and grabbing their crotches. Women, one after another, accusing of Trump of groping them. Still more women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct showing up at a presidential debate.",

The jobs are plentiful, and the jokes write themselves \u2014 so much so that everything started to look and sound the same. Even the audiences sound the same, their laughter and applause forming prolonged squeals of agreement, a noise usually heard at actual political rallies. It\u2019s not news to anyone that over the past four presidential elections, became a way to excite the left and encourage the youth vote through sarcasm and satire.",
        "Only at Neiman Marcus, where you can buy a $395 jacket for a baby who will probably throw up on it, or a $1, 300 tufted sofa for your dog, are collard greens considered \u201cgourmet food. \u201d But there they are, among the holiday offerings: $66 for frozen collard greens, not including $15. 50 in shipping. \u201cI was like, \u2018Whaaaat? \u2019\u201d said Nicole Taylor, author of \u201cThe Up South Cookbook. \u201d \u201cA lot of things ran through my head.

        "U. S. intelligence agencies do not see Russia as capable of using cyberespionage to alter the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, but they have warned that Moscow may continue meddling after the voting has ended to sow doubts about the legitimacy of the result, U.

S. spy agencies that a campaign by Russia to rattle the mechanisms of American democracy will probably continue after polls close on one of the most polarizing races in recent history, extending and amplifying the political turbulence.

        "Senior Republican lawmakers are openly discussing the prospect of impeaching Hillary Clinton should she win the presidency, a stark indication that partisan warfare over her tenure as secretary of state will not end on Election Day. Chairmen of two congressional committees said in media interviews this week they believe Clinton committed impeachable offenses in setting up and using a private email server for official State Department business. And a third senior Republican, the chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, told The Washington Post he is personally convinced Clinton should be impeached for influence peddling involving her family foundation.",
        "WINTERVILLE, N.

        "After Melania Trump delivered a partially plagiarized speech at the Republican National Convention, journalists wondered whether she would speak on the campaign trail again. On Thursday, more than three months later and with just six days left in the election, the first lady finally gave another speech. This one left reporters asking questions, too: Did she just plagiarize Marla Maples? She thinks how many women live in poverty? Has she met her own husband? The last question is a bit facetious, of course. But as Melania Trump denounced cyberbullying, journalists noted that she is married to the year\u2019s .",
        "As soon as Lauren Middledorf starts striking poses, you can tell that she\u2019s done this more than a few times before. Smile. Look at the camera. Look away. Reposition the purse. Tousle hair. Cross legs. Add sunglasses. Repeat. The photographer \u2014 snapping away at her subject on a outdoor plaza \u2014 occasionally chimes in with bits of advice. \u201cTeeth,\u201d she offers at one point, prompting Middledorf to give a broader grin. \u201cLet me take some more of your shoes against that,\u201d she says, betting the sleek black stilettos will pop against a beige block of concrete.",
        "It was the stuffed sheep\u2019s fault. Fuzzy, faded, beloved by Andrea Villa\u2019s charge, remarkable to others only for its talent for disappearing. The toy known as Sheepy would go missing at least once a week, inspiring fits of crying from the little girl and a frantic search by her parents and Villa, their Colombian au pair. Desperate to break the cycle, Villa turned to a tactic she\u2019d learned from watching \u201cSupernanny\u201d: The little girl would put Sheepy in a special spot by the window each time she was done playing with it.",
        "Sixteen years ago I awaited the arrival of Election Day, anxious but hopeful. I was a part of a presidential campaign that had challenged the stereotype of Republicanism with a series of policy proposals on education, addiction treatment and other elements of social welfare. Suspend, for a moment, your views on the efficacy of No Child Left Behind and the initiative. Accept that we viewed the coming election \u2014 if we won \u2014 as the mandate for a certain model of governance. I was deeply and personally invested in the outcome of the 2000 election.",
        "Rule of thumb for a presidential campaign where the two candidates have the highest unfavorable ratings in the history of polling: If you\u2019re the center of attention, you\u2019re losing.
