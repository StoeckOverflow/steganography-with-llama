        "This is no ordinary election. Time for a reminder of what\u2019s at stake: Climate policy and the economy: For anyone who accepts the scientific consensus that global warming poses a clear and present danger, there is only one choice. Hillary Clinton will continue along the path laid out by President Obama and other world leaders. Donald Trump has claimed, ridiculously, that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.",
        "WHEN THE republic was in danger, where did you stand? History will ask that question of Republican leaders who knew that Donald Trump was unfit to be commander in chief. Some said so, despite possible political risks. Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) Sen. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S. C.) former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and former officials such as Brent Scowcroft, Colin L. Powell, Henry M. Paulson Jr. Michael V. Hayden and Robert M. Gates did their best to help Americans understand the risk of electing an ignorant, man with no relevant experience.",
        "Whoever wins Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will face an assertive, aggrieved Russia whose behavior under President Vladimir Putin is increasingly worrisome to U. S. experts. Today\u2019s pushy, headstrong Russia presents a paradox: By most measures, it is a country in decline, with a sagging economy, an underdeveloped technology base and a shrinking population. Corruption pervades nearly every sector. The collapse of the Soviet Union is still an open wound, and many Russians blame the United States for taking advantage of them during their years of decline. Yet this inwardly weak Russia displays the cockiness of a street fighter.",
        "To my fellow millennials: Yeah, I know, you\u2019re scoffing at this salutation. I\u2019m on the older side of our generation, which has been repeatedly redefined downward to represent an increasingly manbunned, microaggressed group of whippersnapchatters. \u201cMillennial\u201d used to refer to a specific cohort born between about 1980 and the \u201990s; now it\u2019s just a generic slur meaning \u201cany annoying person younger than I am. \u201d Still, I beg you, lend a slightly older lady your valuable, monetized eyeballs. For decades, efforts targeting people like you (us, rather) have harnessed the rhetoric of adolescent rebelliousness.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 The Chicago Cubs won the World Series here Wednesday night for the young, the old and the long dead, too. Of course these Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians, in 10 thrilling, innings in Game 7 for themselves, for their own joy and glory. But as they have been reminded endless times in the past seven months of this baseball season, they also won the Cubs\u2019 first title since 1908 for the citizens of a nation without borders.",
        "DES MOINES \u2014 A day after police in Iowa captured a man they say killed two officers in a pair of brazen ambushes, authorities here said they may never truly know the motivation for what one official called \u201ccowardly\u201d attacks. While investigators will try to determine what prompted the attack \u2014 and what, if any, connection it might have had to a confrontation between the suspected gunman and police just weeks earlier \u2014 the Des Moines police chief said he will not be among those trying to discern a reason for the bloodshed.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s plan for getting out of the European Union was thrown into doubt Thursday as a senior court ruled that Prime Minister Theresa May will need to get Parliament\u2019s approval before she acts. The surprise decision introduced new uncertainty to a process already fraught with complication and threatened to derail May\u2019s timetable of triggering Article 50, the mechanism for exiting the E. U. by the end of March.",
        "It\u2019s not clear how, but an interview with Mel Gibson seems to go off the rails even before it begins. Maybe that\u2019s to be expected. The actor and director has become a lightning rod for controversy ever since he was recorded delivering an tirade during a arrest in 2006.",
        "The birth defects caused by Zika have been described in heartbreaking detail as the virus has spread to more than 45 countries, infecting hundreds of thousands of people, including tens of thousands of pregnant women. Now researchers have concluded that a Zika infection during pregnancy is linked to a distinct pattern of birth defects that they are officially calling congenital Zika syndrome.",
        "In August of 2001, a vial of the insulin NovoLog carried a list price of $39. 75 \u2014 matching the price of a competing insulin, Humalog, down to the penny. On Jan. 16, 2002, both drug prices rose to $41. 74. On July 18, both prices rose to $45. 08. On Dec. 19, both drugs rose to $49. 14. Fast forward to November 2015. NovoLog increased to $236. 70. Within two weeks, Humalog was hiked to $237.",
        "On Wednesday, Oct. 12, Jonathan Daniel Ramirez Porter woke up with a fever. His mother, Marijo Ceguzman, decided to keep him home from kindergarten in Ferndale, Wash. a small town less than an hour south of the Canadian border. Instead of getting better, Daniel complained of a severe headache the next day. By Saturday, Oct. 15, he was stumbling and drooling, unable to keep food in his mouth or to speak clearly. Ceguzman and Daniel\u2019s father, Jose Ramirez, brought him to Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, where his condition at first baffled physicians there, his mother said.",
        "If the polls closed right at this moment (which they won\u2019t) and if the results in each state perfectly mirrored the current RealClearPolitics average of polls in each state (which they won\u2019t) Hillary Clinton would be elected president by an electoral college margin of 8 votes. From her high in the polls a week or two ago, Clinton\u2019s leads in a number of critical battleground states have collapsed or evaporated entirely.",
        "A funny thing happened in recent days: Even as Donald Trump appears to have some momentum in the presidential race, the GOP\u2019s odds of holding the Senate appeared to diminish \u2014 at least somewhat. The GOP\u2019s effort to hold the Senate has always been a tough slog, even if it remained competitive at the top of the ballot. And sure enough, despite Trump not appearing to have dragged down his fellow Republicans too much (if at all) the GOP finds itself with what seems to be an increasingly uphill battle to retain the Senate, with five days left.",
        "The entire globe is moving fast to stop climate change. The Paris climate agreement enters into legal force on Friday, and then shortly afterwards comes a first global meeting to start implementing it in Marrakech, Morocco. (Yes, there\u2019s also a U. S. election in there somewhere that could, er, complicate things.) But this flurry of activity nonetheless faces a grim mathematical reality, a new report from the United Nations Environment Programme finds.",
        "The Country Music Association Awards, theoretically a joyful night that celebrates country singers, had a common theme this year: tears. Miranda Lambert wiped her eyes at the end of the show\u2019s emotional opener, which featured a medley of classic country songs that culminated in a singalong of \u201cForever and Ever, Amen\u201d with Randy Travis, who suffered a stroke three years ago. Thomas Rhett said he and Garth Brooks cried together during that performance. Songwriter Lori McKenna broke down when she won song of the year for Tim McGraw\u2019s \u201cHumble and Kind.",
        "To converse with photographer Michael Zagaris is to feel like a bubble inside a just poured ; your head jumps from story to story, happiness swirling around you. Football, baseball, San Francisco, and the music scene all jockey for attention as you speak. Time becomes because you want to hear more about the parties that ended with broken hearts or disbandment. You want to know what life is like inside the world of sports while the crowd sits outside. To his and he has he is \u201cZ.",
        "HERSHEY, Pa. \u2014 Declaring \u201cour country\u2019s gone to hell,\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday pledged to secure the borders, rebuild inner cities and end government corruption during a raucous rally here four days before the election. Trump boasted of tightening poll numbers in key battleground states as he laid out his vision for the country, which he said would include fixing \u201cinner cities,\u201d which he said are \u201cso bad. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re unsafe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou get shot walking to the store for a loaf of bread. They have no jobs.",
        "Fox News anchor Bret Baier apologized Friday for reporting that federal investigators had determined that Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server had been hacked and that an investigation would lead to an indictment of Clinton after the election. In fact, Baier said, after checking with his sources, there is no evidence at this time for either statement. Baier, the anchor of Fox\u2019s evening newscast \u201cSpecial Report,\u201d went on the air Wednesday to report that the FBI had determined that Clinton\u2019s private server, which she used while serving as secretary of state, had been hacked by \u201cfive foreign intelligence agencies.",
        "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s political career sustained a serious blow Friday after two of his former allies were found guilty of conspiring to shut down the nation\u2019s busiest bridge to punish a local mayor who refused to support the governor\u2019s reelection bid. While Christie wasn\u2019t charged in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d trial, the case produced a steady stream of new allegations against the governor that probably will haunt him as he tries to position himself as a significant player in a potential Donald Trump administration.",
        "The last week has been a tough one for Hillary Clinton. Last Friday\u2019s announcement by FBI Director James Comey that emails considered \u201cpertinent\u201d to the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server had been discovered accelerated a bump in Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers that had begun before that news hit. National polling was the first to tighten \u2014 the Tracking Poll showed the Democratic presidential candidate up three points on Friday \u2014 but polling has followed suit. CNN, as of Friday morning, even had Clinton below 270 electoral votes for the first time in a long time.",
        "Hillary Clinton has a narrow edge over Donald Trump heading into the final weekend of a campaign where 3 in 10 likely voters say they\u2019ve already cast their ballots, according to a new Washington News Tracking Poll. Likely voters currently break 47 percent for Clinton and 43 percent for Trump in interviews conducted Monday through Thursday, a lead that is within the range of sampling error and similar to Clinton\u2019s margin in the previous wave but the largest numerical gap between candidates in the past week of daily tracking.",
        "Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary from 2001 to 2003, is president of Ari Fleischer Communications. I\u2019m a white, male. People like me typically vote Republican for president. In 2012, when Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama by four percentage points, Romney won my demographic group by 21 points. I\u2019m also married. Romney beat Obama by 22 points among married men. This year, I\u2019m struggling with how to vote. I voted against Donald Trump in the GOP primary and regularly criticized him.",
        "Hillary Clinton s top priority, if she is elected president, shouldn t be enacting an infrastructure plan or pushing immigration reform. It should be \u201d must be, if she is to succeed on any substantive front \u201d to combat her own worst instincts. To be clear, I desperately want to see Clinton elected, not only because the alternative is Donald Trump and not only because it is time for a woman in the White House. Clinton has the experience, intelligence, skill and discipline to be an excellent president.",
        "Danielle Pletka is senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Donald Trump is probably going to lose the election Tuesday. For many Republicans and conservatives, that will be a blessed release from an annus horribilis. But we will make a fatal error going forward if we do not acknowledge what Trump got right and attempt to fix the problems that enabled his hostile takeover of the GOP. Consider the Trump themes that resonated deeply with tens of millions of Americans: We don\u2019t win anymore. We have no strategy to fight our enemies.",
        "You can feel the tension. Strolling down the street, shopping at the corner market, stopping for a bite at the local tavern, friends and neighbors greet each other as usual but avoid the elephant sauntering around like he owns the place. It\u2019s best not to talk politics this close to the election. But when an impudent columnist asks the next fellow in the grocery line \u2014 \u201cHave you voted yet?\u201d \u2014 and his answer hints at a Trump ballot, neighboring eyes cast downward, while sparks sizzle in their human casings. A brief frisson has transpired.",
        "IT WAS disruptive enough that James B. Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, injected uncertainty into the presidential campaign by announcing discovery of additional emails in the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server. Mr. Comey\u2019s explanation for the disclosure, that he needed to keep Congress informed, was dubious, and the damaging impact, casting a new shadow over Ms. Clinton, was tangible. In the days since, the FBI\u2019s behavior has grown even more questionable. FBI sources have fanned new doubts about Ms. Clinton\u2019s candidacy with inaccurate leaks about an investigation of the Clinton Foundation.",
        "Tuesday evening, after Election Day\u2019s tranquility, new clamors will erupt as analysts with agendas tickle portents and lessons from the torrent of election returns. Herewith some developments to watch. \u25cf In the 17 elections since World War II, the winner has averaged 385. 4 electoral votes, the loser 145. 1. In six elections (1952, 1956, 1964, 1972, 1980, 1984) a candidate won fewer than 100. In the seven elections after 1984, no Democrat has received fewer than 111 (Michael Dukakis in 1988) and no Republican fewer than 159 (Bob Dole in 1996). Measure Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump accordingly.",
        "Federal authorities are investigating a possible threat from to carry out terror attacks, leading officials in at least three states to take precautions, according to federal and state officials. The nature of the threat, which CBS News reported first, remains vague, and local and federal authorities said they are still assessing whether or not it is credible. A federal official and state authorities said law enforcement in New York, Texas and Virginia had been notified of the possible danger and were working with their federal counterparts.",
        "CHARLOTTESVILLE \u2014 A federal court jury decided Friday that a Rolling Stone journalist defamed a former University of Virginia associate dean in a 2014 magazine article about sexual assault on campus that included a debunked account of a fraternity gang rape. The jury concluded that the Rolling Stone reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, was responsible for defamation, with actual malice, in the case brought by Nicole Eramo, a . administrator who oversaw sexual violence cases at the time of the article\u2019s publication.",
        "LONDON \u2014 A day after the stunning High Court ruling that threatens to derail British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plans to withdraw from the European Union, few in Britain were suggesting that Brexit is dead. But for the first time since the June 23 referendum that so crushed . U. voters, there were glimmers of hope on the \u201cremain\u201d side that Britain will opt for something other than a hard exit from the E. U."
