        "GOGJALI, Iraq \u2014 The vehicles screeched into the small field hospital on the outskirts of Mosul carrying desperate loads: soldiers injured in battle as well as men, women and children caught in the crossfire of Iraq\u2019s war against the Islamic State. Some staggered out clutching bleeding wounds; others were lifted by medics onto stretchers. They had come with chlorine gas, mortar fire, bombs and artillery shells. For a few, it was too late, and instead of a stretcher, a body bag waited. The medical station, manned by medics from Iraq\u2019s special forces alongside U. S.",
        "With the imminent arrival of its lone aircraft carrier off the coast of Syria, Russia is set to bulk up its military campaign ahead of what probably will be a renewed bombing campaign on the besieged city of Aleppo. The Admiral Kuznetsov, the Russian Navy\u2019s flagship, was last seen steaming through the Mediterranean toward the Syrian coast after a refueling that \u2014 incredibly \u2014 was captured by satellite. It is unclear exactly where the carrier, technically known as a \u201cheavy aviation cruiser,\u201d and its accompanying battlegroup actually are in relation to its final destination.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan moved Friday to tamp down speculation that he might step down from his post after Election Day, telling a Wisconsin radio station that he planned to stand for reelection in the next Congress. \u201cI am going to seek staying on as speaker,\u201d Ryan ( .) said on WTAQ radio in Green Bay. Separately, he told an Associated Press reporter much the same during a campaign stop in Mosinee, Wis. when asked about a Thursday article in The Hill about mounting speculation that he might step down. \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read,\u201d Ryan said.",
        "On Tuesday, Nov. 7, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson went to bed thinking he had lost the White House. His GOP challenger, Charles Evans Hughes, had already won the big East Coast prizes \u2014 New York and Pennsylvania were worth a combined 83 electoral votes at the time \u2014 and the Midwest was solidly Hughes country. But over the next two days, as votes trickled in from west of the Mississippi, Wilson cleaned up in those time zones. With California\u2019s 13 electoral votes, he won reelection. The newspapers finally made it official that Friday.",
        "Rep. Kevin Cramer ( . D.) said in a letter to television executives on Friday that \u201cnational network news has devolved from journalism to surreptitious propaganda,\u201d and he raised the specter of a congressional hearing to \u201cexplore network media bias in coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign. \u201d Cramer\u2019s timing is a bit odd. The election is Tuesday, meaning that any such hearing would come too late to affect coverage of the race (although, of course, the prospect of such a hearing is being raised in the campaign homestretch).",
        "Two New York police officers were shot and injured Friday during an incident in the Bronx, according to authorities. A suspect involved in the shooting was also \u201cstruck,\u201d J. Peter Donald, a New York Police spokesman, posted on Twitter. The injured officers were brought to Jacobi Medical Center, a hospital in the Bronx, according to a spokeswoman for the police department. One of the officers has died, Melissa speaker of the New York City Council, posted online. Police officials had not immediately confirmed that, though some local news organizations, citing unnamed police department sources, reported that an officer died.",
        "Welcome to the latest edition of What Was Fake on the Internet this Election, a frequently recurring column where we round up the fake and misleading stories on the Internet about the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead of the usual list of a handful of hoaxes, we are devoting this entire edition to a conspiracy theory claiming that John Podesta is a Satanist. Buckle up.",
        "Lisa Allison told police that one of her students was \u201cmaking noises\u201d before she told him to leave her classroom at Landis Elementary School in Houston. Allison later told an Alief Independent School District police officer that the boy began kicking lockers after leaving the classroom, prompting Allison to go outside and escort the child to the school office. But they never made it there. What happened next, police say, is why the teacher has been removed from her job and charged with felony injury to a child, according to ABC affiliate KTRK.",
        "With hours until Election Day, the wildest U. S. presidential race in memory has grown more competitive in most of the battleground states, although Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton continues to hold a broader path to victory than Republican Donald Trump. The political map suggests that Clinton can lose several key states long assumed to be in her column and still reach the 270 electoral votes she needs to win. Trump, meanwhile, has a new reason for optimism, as a growing number of states appear potentially within his grasp.",
        "RENO \u2014 Donald Trump was rushed off stage Saturday night during a campaign rally here as security officials swarmed, but the candidate emerged back on stage after a few minutes and finished his speech. The U. S. Secret Service later said in a statement that it took action after \u201can unidentified individual shouted \u2018gun\u2019\u201d in front of the stage. Agents apprehended the person, but found no gun, the statement said, adding that an investigation into the incident continues. The man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was released shortly after the incident, according to reports.",
        "In the tabloid business, the practice is called \u201ccatch and kill. \u201d That phrase was circulating on Saturday after the Wall Street Journal\u2019s solidly reported story that the National Enquirer \u2014 no stranger to checkbook journalism \u2014 had laid out $150, 000 in August to a former Playboy magazine Playmate, who says she had a lengthy adulterous affair with Donald Trump a decade ago.

        "At long last, Americans get to decide. More than usual, most people don\u2019t like their choices. More than usual, many Americans believe that people who don\u2019t agree with them are not only wrong but are also best avoided. On the eve of the election, America is afraid. People talk about buying guns to protect themselves from troubles to come. They talk about places they steer clear of and people they don\u2019t talk to anymore. Casual conversations have blown up into hurtful arguments. Friends vanish from Facebook feeds.",
        "Melania Trump, the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and an immigrant from Slovenia, was paid for 10 modeling jobs in 1996 before she received legal authorization to work in the United States, the Associated Press reported Friday night. The AP cited detailed ledgers from Melania Trump\u2019s modeling agency, as well as a contract she signed with the firm, concluding she was paid more than $20, 000 for the work over a period of seven weeks. The finding contradicts repeated statements from both Melania and Donald Trump, who have insisted that she scrupulously followed U. S.",
        "When Donald Trump loses, he lashes out, assigns blame and does whatever it takes to make a defeat look like a win. When that isn\u2019t plausible, he pronounces the system rigged \u2014 victory wasn\u2019t possible because someone put in the fix. In a career in which glittering buildings and a flamboyant lifestyle have been tempered by bankruptcies and failed ventures, Trump has consistently fought \u2014 often successfully \u2014 to recast each defeat as proof of his strategic savvy.",
        "Anyone who has ever been a candidate will tell you that politics is a business. Cheap shots, low blows and worse are to be expected. Good campaigns prepare responses and deflections. What campaigns do not prepare for, however, are sudden broadsides from law enforcement. That\u2019s what happened to Hillary Clinton in recent days. The same thing happened to me, too. In March 2014, one week before the beginning of early voting in the District\u2019s Democratic primary, . S. Attorney Ronald Machen dropped a bombshell on my mayoral reelection campaign.",
        "Dan Gardner, a journalist, and Philip E. Tetlock, a psychologist the University of Pennsylvania, are the authors of \u201cSuperforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction. \u201d It\u2019s hard to recall another time as uncertain as this. Americans are worried that they are vulnerable to terrorist attacks that they won\u2019t have enough money to retire or pay medical bills that jobs are becoming less secure and that the next generation will be worse off financially than their parents . And they are downright frightened by the election.",
        "FBI Director James Comey\u2019s 9. political earthquake, announcing in a vague letter to Congress 11 days before the election that new evidence of unknown importance had surfaced in the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, has shined a bright light on the bureau\u2019s unique role in Washington. Here are some myths about its culture and power. Myth No. 1 The FBI isn\u2019t political. One of J.",
        "If time flies when you\u2019re having fun, this election season is the political equivalent of a visit to the dentist. Election Day is just two weeks away, and time seems to be slowing to a crawl. The Access Hollywood videotape, in which Republican candidate Donald Trump was caught making lewd remarks about women on a hot mic, was released only a little over two weeks ago. Since then, the tenor of the election has sunk further with the release of more allegations of sexual assault against Trump and leaked emails from the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton.",
        "It may have taken protests and graphic videos of people being killed by cops for some to get the message that policing in America is in crisis. But pop culture has been steadily warning audiences about this for years. You can watch blockbusters about the impact of the drug war, TV shows about the rot of institutional dysfunction and documentaries about the improper use of force by cops. No wonder public confidence in the police hit a low last year, with only 52 percent of Americans telling Gallup pollsters that they have deep trust in police.",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 After April Campbell\u2019s son was shot to death in May about four blocks from their home, she took it upon herself to help police find the killer. Campbell, 49, disabled with a spinal injury, grabbed her walker and went door to door on the city\u2019s South Side trying to piece together a motive and gather evidence. She found witnesses and urged them to talk to police. She collected Facebook posts by people who seemed to claim credit for his killing.",

        "The \u2018Vigilante\u2019 phone app shows where crime is being reported, so users can either avoid the area or go there with cameras. Apple has removed it from its App Store. (Jack ) Information is power, they say. So the makers of a new phone app, \u201cVigilante,\u201d believe that letting people know when any nearby crime in progress is being reported to the police, thereby enabling users to either avoid or approach the area, is empowering.

        "Two men were arrested Saturday in connection with spray painting at several buildings in downtown Washington including the Trump International Hotel and the FBI building, both on Pennsylvania Avenue. Eric Roberts, 27, of Florida, was arrested and charged with defacing government property and resisting arrest. Danny Hamilton, 35, of Louisiana was charged with destruction of D. C. government property for damaging a police cruiser and with resisting arrest, according to the D. C. police. The police said in a release that both men were arrested for offenses that occurred during the Million Mask March demonstration.",
        "Outside of Washington, Republicans dominate state politics. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to governors\u2019 mansions: The GOP holds 31 out of 50 seats. And if they pick up just one more Tuesday, Republicans will tie a record for the most seats controlled by their party, set in 1998. Democrats aren\u2019t going to let that happen without a fight. Despite a challenging election cycle in which they are defending five open seats, Democrats are in a position to hold on to most of those and even knock off a Republican governor.",

The polls stayed open until 10 p. m. at that store, with a local television network reporting that voters were waiting two hours to cast a ballot.",
        "Donald Trump is the most unpopular nominee in modern history, and he could still be elected president on Tuesday. How could this happen? Part of it is that Hillary Clinton is also unpopular. But most of it is partisanship, pure and simple. It\u2019s actually pretty astounding if you look at all the numbers just how many areas Clinton leads in.",
        "Shortly after her daughter arrived at school, Eboni Banks got a phone call. Her was wearing leggings and her shirt apparently wasn\u2019t long enough, in violation of her school\u2019s dress code. Her daughter asked: Could Banks please bring a pair of jeans to school? Banks rushed to Mattawoman Middle School in Waldorf, Md. where she found her daughter, then 11, sitting in the nurse\u2019s office, rather than class, because of her attire: a black shirt, pink sweater jacket and a pair of leggings. Under school rules, the outfit crossed the line. Leggings could be a distraction.",
