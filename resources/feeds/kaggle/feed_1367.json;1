        "The act disgusted officers in San Antonio so much that they reported one of their own to internal affairs. On bike patrol one night in May, Officer Matthew Luckhurst placed feces between two pieces of bread, city officials said. He slipped the fecal sandwich ? into a Styrofoam container, and placed it next to a sleeping homeless man. Then he bragged about the act to\u00c2 another officer. Officers reported Luckhurst in July, which launched\u00c2 an unsuccessful search for the homeless man as well as\u00c2 an internal investigation.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s better if he loves you a little bit more. \u201d This was the relationship wisdom my mother imparted to me when I was a teenager and had barely experienced a crush. I found the idea mystifying and immediately rejected it. Shouldn\u2019t it be equal? Wasn\u2019t one person in the relationship with stronger feelings just setting themselves up for heartbreak? \u201cIt will make everything a little bit easier,\u201d she reasoned. At the time, I was firmly in my teenage rebellion phase. After believing every single thing my parents told me over the years, it was time to question everything.",

Which horse wins matters less than being in on the secret \u2014 finding your way on a Sunday afternoon to this improbable oasis of Latino cowboy pageantry called Rancho La Pura Vida, in Remington, Va.

        "FBI Director James B. Comey notified key members of Congress Sunday afternoon that after reviewing all of the newly discovered Hillary Clinton emails the agency stands by its original findings against recommending charges.

Vote early to ensure a President Trump does not deport us.

At least 13 Russian warplanes coursed through the skies. And the NATO fighter jets kept rushing into the air to meet them.",
        "Unfiltered free publicity for Donald Trump. A for Hillary Clinton. Paid pundits in the tank for candidates, right and left. False equivalency that put one candidate\u2019s lack of news conferences on a par with another\u2019s racism and misogyny. Yes, we the media have done all this and more over the past 18 months. American journalism \u2014 unloved and distrusted to begin with \u2014 will emerge from the presidential campaign with its reputation more tarnished than ever. But there were moments that stand out in a positive way, too.",

        "This post has been updated. Donald Trump was quickly rushed by Secret Service at a campaign rally in Reno, Nev. on Saturday night as a scuffle erupted in the crowd directly in front of the stage and a man was led away.

Pence told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace that the Trump campaign will \u201caccept a clear election outcome\u201d but will pursue any legal remedies necessary short of that standard. What will amount to a clear election outcome or a questionable one was not specified.",
        "There was one final \u201dSaturday Night Live\u201d left before the 2016 election, but there was no debate to send up. Instead, SNL went with some pretty strong political commentary. And it wasn\u2019t friendly to Donald Trump \u2014 or the media. The cold open featured Alec Baldwin returning as Trump and being interviewed alongside Hillary Clinton on CNN. Over the course of the interview, Trump literally kissed \u2014 on the mouth \u2014 an FBI agent, Russian President Vladimir Putin and a member of the KKK, only to have the CNN host quickly return the discussion to Clinton\u2019s emails.",

The Republican nominee, who was set to hold rallies in five states from Florida to Michigan on Monday, said that the fact that the FBI had already completed its examination of newly discovered emails connected to Clinton proved that the judicial system was \u201crigged.",
        "On Sept. 25 last year, several thousand people gathered on a Friday night around a bandshell at the Great State Fair of Oklahoma for what felt like a rock concert.

        "In the waning days of a bitter, exhausting, enervating election season, President Obama has often seemed to be the only person in America who is still having fun. On each of his stops for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he has been greeted by screaming crowds and a palpable nostalgia embodied by the same largely improvised exchange. \u201cI love you,\u201d a voice from the crowd inevitably calls. \u201cLove you, too,\u201d Obama always replies.",

        "In the final hours, the mask came off. Donald Trump and his surrogates have been playing footsie with American for months: tweeting their memes, retweeting their messages, appearing on their radio shows.

S. sovereignty\u201d and that \u201ca global power structure\u201d is conspiring against ordinary Americans, the League urged Trump to \u201cavoid rhetoric and tropes that historically have been used against Jews. \u201d Well, Trump just gave his reply.",

        "So all the histrionics about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails amounted, in the end, to nothing, nada, zilch. Next to the word \u201cfiasco\u201d in the dictionary should be a picture of FBI Director James B. Comey. Should his picture be next to the word \u201ccatastrophe\u201d as well?
