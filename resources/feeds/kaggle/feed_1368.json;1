        "The first sentence of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s memoir reads: \u201cAll my life I have thought of France in a certain way. \u201d This is a presidential election, more than any I can remember, that has invited Americans to view their country in a certain way \u2014 actually, in one of two very different ways. Donald Trump\u2019s vision is unremittingly dark \u2014 in his words, a \u201ccrippled America.",
        "As Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the polls collapses, Democrats are panicking at the possibility that Donald Trump actually could be elected president of the United States. They can relax. Strip away the incendiary rhetoric, and a Trump presidency in many ways will be exactly what Democrats want \u2014 a third Obama term. While Trump attacks President Obama on the campaign trail as \u201cthe worst president, maybe in the history of our country,\u201d on issue after issue Trump has mimicked not only Obama\u2019s policies but also Obama\u2019s own language to argue for them.

        "Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday in the trial of a man charged with killing nine black parishioners at a Charleston church last year, but a federal judge abruptly postponed it without offering much of an explanation.

For more than a year, undercover investigators in San Joaquin County, California tracked the sales of food \u2014 such as homemade tamales, tortillas and cakes \u2014 through a community Facebook group, a sting that Mariza Ruelas called a \u201cwaste of time and resources and taxpayers\u2019 money.",
        "Global markets were up significantly and the Standard & Poor\u2019s index broke its longest slide in nearly 36 years on Monday as investors bet on a Hillary Clinton victory over Republican Donald Trump going into Tuesday\u2019s election. \u201cThis is the Comey celebration,\u201d said Washington investor Michael Farr, referring to FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s letter to Congress on Sunday saying his agency\u2019s investigation of Clinton\u2019s emails was complete and there would be no prosecution.

        "As the first polls closed Tuesday, anxious Americans awaited an indication of who would prevail at the end of a historically bitter presidential contest whether Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would hold on to her narrow lead or Republican Donald Trump would secure a stunning upset. The first polling places in the country, in parts of Indiana and Kentucky, closed at 6 p. m. Eastern time. But no states will be \u201ccalled\u201d for either candidate until an hour later, at 7 p. m. Eastern.",
        "JANESVILLE, WIS. \u2014 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan is something of a political legend here in his hometown. There was near universal agreement among voters here Tuesday that Ryan seems like a guy, most people just call him Paul, and they are proud to see him on the national stage. But some Republicans in his home state and across the country still feel uncomfortable that he never seemed to fully embrace GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump during the campaign.",
        "As voters flooded polling places across the country on Election Day, some reported problems such as broken machines, long lines and voter intimidation in states ranging from Texas to Pennsylvania. While voting appeared to proceed without headaches in many locations, election observers said they expect a significant increase in the number of issues reported nationwide.

        "There comes a point when all of the campaigning is over. There are no more rallies to be held, no more stump speeches to be delivered, no more hearts and minds to be won. The only thing left is the voting \u2014 and the counting. And it can be hard to wait. Trust us. We know. We\u2019d like to know how this is all going to play out, too. To that end, we have a few solutions.",
        "Ann Coulter rarely rises to the level of deserving serious attention, and I am very open to the argument that this is not one of those moments. But a tweet she offered on Monday night, hours before Election Day polls opened across the country, offers some insight into the composition of the United States and into its history. Also, it\u2019s gross and deserves to be identified as such. Here\u2019s the tweet. If only people with at least 4 grandparents born in America were voting, Trump would win in a landslide.",
        "It\u2019s hard out there for a Democrat. Republicans control both chambers of Congress, state legislatures in 31 states and governors\u2019 mansions in 31 states. But progressive groups think they have found a way to circumvent Republicans\u2019 stranglehold on government: ballot initiatives. In recent years, they have had spectacular success changing state policy on issues including guns and minimum wage despite Republican legislatures. And they\u2019re hoping to expand on this strategy in November in a big way. Which means that Tuesday, voters in 35 states are voting on 157 ballot initiatives.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign tried to make the case Tuesday that the presidential election in Las Vegas\u2019s home county might be rigged. The court definitely didn\u2019t agree. On Tuesday afternoon, a state court judge quickly and somewhat angrily dismissed the Trump campaign\u2019s lawsuit seeking to put some early ballots on hold for no discernible reason. Here\u2019s what went down: On Tuesday, the Trump campaign alleged that the Clark County Registrar of Voters \u2014 which runs elections in the heavily Hispanic, heavily Democratic Las Vegas area \u2014 kept the polls open for early voting \u201ctwo hours beyond \u2026 closing time.",
        "Long before the first polling places opened on Election Day 2016, the race for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination was already underway. It has been unfolding in early primary states, where potential candidates have been introducing or reintroducing themselves. It has been on display in purple battlegrounds where they are helping in contests. And behind the scenes, contenders have sought face time with party power brokers eager to size them up. \u201cI think it\u2019s already happening now,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.) a veteran GOP strategist.",
        "On Tuesday night, voters won\u2019t just determine who captures the White House, but whether Republicans retain the congressional majority they have held for the last two years. The Senate majority will likely be determined by a handful of hotly contested seats, as Democrats need to pick up just four or five seats to regain the majority lost in the 2014 midterms (four if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton prevails; five if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins).",

Her name, he told me, was Madelynn. \u201cWhat about her middle name?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell,\u201d my son said, \u201cwe are thinking we might want it to be Armao. \u201d I was stunned, and later, when they made it official in a Facebook posting \u2014 Madelynn Armao McNiece \u2014 I started to cry.

        "As the 2016 election draws to a close, we asked our opinion writers to predict the winner of the presidential election, and by how many electoral votes, as well as the fates of the Senate and House. The Senate currently has 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats (two senators are independents who caucus with the Democrats); the House of Representatives has 247 Republicans and 188 Democrats. Here\u2019s what our writers projected. Jonathan Capehart President: Hillary Clinton 318, Donald Trump 220.

        "The right to vote, accepting the will of the voters and the peaceful transfer of power are the three legs of the stool of American democracy. That Donald Trump continues to play coy on whether he would \u201ckeep you in suspense\u201d about accepting the election results was and remains an unprecedented and violation of faith. But if the election does not go his way on Tuesday, Trump could be hailed as the savior of the republic by conceding with uncharacteristic grace.",
        "There\u2019s still hours of voting yet to go before we begin to find out who our next president will be. But this much we can be sure of: Nate Silver was right. If Donald Trump wins, Silver, the genius behind the popular website FiveThirtyEight, called it. He said on ABC News on Sunday that Hillary Clinton is \u201cone state away from potentially losing the electoral college. \u201d And if Clinton wins the electoral college? Silver predicted that, too. His website on Tuesday gave her a 71 percent chance of winning the electoral vote. Same with the popular vote.",

Already many are asking: What will the upstart politician do with his newfound fame and popular support? The question has establishment Republicans both in Utah and Washington worried. Tuesday night, the previously undercover and unknown McMullin might become the first party candidate to win a state\u2019s electoral votes since 1968.",
        "If Hillary Clinton wins, at some point tonight she\u2019ll deliver a victory in which she\u2019ll speak the words \u201cDonald Trump\u201d or \u201cmy opponent,\u201d quiet the brief eruption of boos, then read the words she and her aides have carefully crafted for that moment. She will be gracious and kind, congratulating him on running a spirited and improbable campaign, and asking for his help and the help of all his voters to move the country toward our shared goals of peace and prosperity.",
        "HAMAM Iraq \u2014 There are bodies here and they were dumped on piles of trash in a windswept field of dirt at the edge of a small Iraqi town that until two days ago had been occupied by Islamic State fighters. Other things were less clear. The latest mass grave in a series of mass graves left behind by captured, retreating or dead Islamic State militants was discovered Monday.

        "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s royal family should be used to being fodder for the country\u2019s news grinder. After all, British tabloids and other outlets have poked and prodded into nearly every regal recess, including the meltdown of the marriage between Prince Charles and Princess Diana and the wearing of a outfit by their son Prince Harry for a costume party years ago.
