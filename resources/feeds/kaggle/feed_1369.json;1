        "TOKYO \u2014 A humbled South Korean president essentially withdrew her nominee for prime minister Tuesday, marking another setback in her attempts to quell a snowballing corruption scandal. Park had to walk past opposition lawmakers holding signs saying \u201cstep down\u201d to get into the National Assembly on Tuesday, where she made a rare visit to see Chung the speaker of South Korea\u2019s parliament. \u201cI came to meet the speaker, as it is my great responsibility to normalize state affairs,\u201d Park told Chung, from the opposition Minjoo Party, during their meeting, according to local reports.",
        "Prudential Center, Boston, 1978 (Richard Sandler) Stare. It is the way to educate your eye, and more. Stare, pry, listen, eavesdrop. Die knowing something. You are not here long. \u2014 Walker Evans It is always the instantaneous reaction to oneself that produces a photograph. \u2014 Robert Frank Richard Sandler\u2019s book, \u201cThe Eyes of the City\u201d (Powerhouse, 2016) opens with those two quotes. And they couldn\u2019t be more relevant to the body of work that follows.",
        "Both Hillary Clinton and President Obama urged their backers Wednesday to accept Donald Trump\u2019s victory and support his transition into power, as Democrats prepare to hand over control of the White House for the first time in eight years. The calls for a national political reconciliation underscored the seismic political realignment now underway in Washington after Clinton\u2019s crushing loss to the New York businessman. Both the president and his former Secretary of State told their supporters not to despair as Republicans rejoiced at the idea that they will control both the legislative and executive branch in two months.",
        "This fall, after Iranian naval vessels veered dangerously close to American ships in the Middle East, Donald Trump promised a swift response. \u201cWith Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats, and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee told supporters in September.",
        "If Donald Trump sticks to the immigration pledges that helped drive his presidential election victory, he will begin a clampdown on illegal immigration that would be unprecedented in American history and would require an exorbitantly expensive \u2014 and logistically difficult \u2014 operation to remove millions from the country while fortifying the border. As a candidate, Trump made immigration one of his issues, saying he\u2019d create a \u201cspecial deportation task force\u201d and build a \u201cbeautiful\u201d wall along a major part of the southern border with Mexico.",
        "For the past six years, no law has served as a larger GOP whipping post than the Affordable Care Act, and the Republican sweep Tuesday of political Washington has imperiled the ACA\u2019s expansive reach, putting at risk the insurance that more than 20 million Americans have gained. During the final week of his campaign, Donald Trump vowed to repeal the 2010 law so swiftly that he might summon Congress into a special session to accomplish the task. \u201cWe will do it, and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe,\u201d he said.",
        "The political earthquake that hit Tuesday night has enormous consequences for the Supreme Court, swallowing up Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination and dismantling Democratic hopes for a liberal majority on the high court for the first time in nearly a . In the short term, Republican Donald Trump\u2019s victory means that at some point next year, the court will be restored to full capacity, once again with a majority of justices.",
        "Eight years ago, unprecedented throngs of Americans rushed into the streets in the middle of the night. People cried, hugged strangers, kissed cops, shared champagne. The country had just elected its first black president, and it felt as if liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, were on the same team, if only for a rousing moment, and that team had just won the World Series. Of course, it quickly became clear that Barack Obama had won office in a divided nation hungry for change but also mistrustful of authority, suspicious of nearly everything.",
        "RALEIGH, N. C. \u2014 Shadi Sadi woke up Wednesday with his stomach in knots. He walked to his son\u2019s room to get him ready for school. \u201cWho won?\u201d Bilal asked as he pulled out of his Marvel superhero sheets. Sadi, 34, could hardly say the words. \u201cDonald Trump won,\u201d he said. Bilal\u2019s jaw dropped, and his dad tried to remain calm as he walked downstairs to prepare breakfast. About an hour away, in the small, heavily town of Dunn, truck driver Gary Godwin strode into Sherry\u2019s Bakery with a smile on his face.",
        "Let me sum up the 2016 election in two words: holy crap. This election is one for the ages, an epic upset that 100 years from now, we will all be discussing on our apparats. As always after big news events, I picked some of the best and worst of the elections. My winners and losers are below. (And, no, this won\u2019t likely be my final word on the winners and the losers. Think of this as a first of a several part series.) Winners \u2022 Donald Trump: He was right.",
        "Donald Trump said at a debate last month that he would appoint a special prosecutor to examine Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state and remarked that she would \u201cbe in jail\u201d if he were president. In about two months, he\u2019ll have the power to potentially make that a reality. He wouldn\u2019t, of course, be able to snap his fingers and throw his political rival behind bars.",
        "Markets ended on a high note Wednesday after suffering dramatic drops early in the morning after Donald Trump\u2019s historic presidential victory. That has some investors wondering what a Trump White House could mean for their portfolios. During his campaign, Trump proposed major policy changes \u2014 from overhauling the tax code, to repealing the Affordable Care Act and renegotiating trade deals \u2014 that could have huge implications for businesses and consumers.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 A striking change came over Moscow just hours after Donald Trump\u2019s surprise election: Suddenly, the Russian capital was a hotbed of zealous supporters of the U. S. electoral process. Throughout the campaign, Russia rooted for Trump as much as any other foreign country. According to the White House, Moscow also interfered as much as any other foreign country ever has in a U. S. election. But the Kremlin\u2019s commentators \u2014 convinced that Hillary Clinton was going to win \u2014 had also trashed the U. S. election as dirty, corrupt and unable to produce a legitimate result.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s stunning victory will force the United States to confront a series of entanglements over the president\u2019s private business, debts and rocky financial history. No laws prohibit Trump from involving himself in his private company, the Trump Organization, while serving in the highest public office. And Trump has so far resisted the presidential tradition of giving his holdings to an independent manager, stoking worries of conflicts of interests over his businesses\u2019 many financial and foreign ties. Trump\u2019s business empire of hotels, golf courses and licensing deals in the U. S.",
        "Donald Trump, the walked to the stage at his victory party in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. He stood against a backdrop of precisely aligned American flags and took his place behind a lectern, which he gripped on either side with his hands. America\u2019s most bombastic showman of the century was ready to take his bow. Trump\u2019s suit was black and than usual. His tie was bright red and his shirt, with its French cuffs, was white. A single Old Glory pin was attached to his jacket\u2019s left lapel.",
        "MANY AMERICANS awoke Wednesday morning to wonder if they were welcome in their own land. This feeling of alienation was different from the normal jolt we get when our party or candidate loses an election. That moment of disappointment, though also painful, is one of the costs we bear for living in a democracy \u2014 and caring passionately about how it is run. Donald Trump\u2019s victory brought a more visceral pain to many because it was not just a matter of R\u2019s and D\u2019s. Mr.",
        "All Americans who are alarmed, angry and disheartened that a large minority of our fellow citizens made Donald Trump the must quickly learn to distinguish between blame and responsibility. I freely admit that my own list of those who deserve to be held accountable is long. It includes Russian President Vladimir Putin, who intervened shamelessly in our internal affairs, and FBI Director James B. Comey who, apparently under pressure from politicized bureau agents, changed the trajectory of the campaign and helped accomplish what the former KGB operative could not have achieved on his own.",
        "For those of us who viewed a potential Donald Trump presidency with alarm, the only thing more troubling than his victory Tuesday is the manner in which he won. If Trump had run a conventional campaign, and if it had earned him a lead in the polls for weeks before Election Day, then his triumph would have been a normal event, in the eyes of both his supporters and his foes. Instead, he broke all the rules of American politics (and politesse) on his way to proving false a expert consensus that his election was not possible.",
        "Richard H. Kohn is an emeritus professor of history and peace, war and defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dear Republican national security expert: Like dozens of other prominent GOP national security leaders, you may have publicly opposed Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in harsh terms. (Or perhaps you found him appalling but kept your views to yourself.) Now that he will be moving into the White House, however, you must serve in a Trump administration if given the opportunity.",
        "When I opened my front door Wednesday morning after little sleep and numb from a bad dream that wasn\u2019t a dream, a dreary rainfall glazed the sidewalk as two neighbors gazed blankly in my direction. As I leaned down to pick up my newspaper, a Carole King song filtered through my brain fog: Something inside has died, and I can\u2019t hide, and I just can\u2019t fake it, oh, no, no. Good ol\u2019 Carole King.",
        "DONALD TRUMP was for less than a day before Republicans in Congress began gearing up to move policy in a way the country has not seen in six years. \u201cThe opportunity is to go big, to go bold, to get things done,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) declared. The last time one party controlled Congress and the White House, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law. This time, Obamacare is on the chopping block. Full repeal seems unlikely for a variety of practical and political reasons.",
        "The number of civilians killed by U. S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria is more than double the previous estimate, U. S. Central Command said on Wednesday, after reexamining its air campaign based on allegations from activist groups. The announcement of 64 additional deaths brings the total civilian death toll in U. S. air attacks to 119 since the campaign against the Islamic State began in 2014, Centcom said. The command, responsible for U. S. military operations in the Middle East, is investigating other allegations.",
        "TRENTON, N. J. \u2014 Republican Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s administration has seized power in Atlantic City, taking control of the assets and major in the struggling seaside gambling resort that is half a billion dollars in debt. The New Jersey Local Finance Board voted Wednesday to take over the city\u2019s main governmental functions after the state government rejected a proposed financial turnaround plan. The state can now sell assets including the former Bader Field airport property and the city\u2019s water utility.",
        "A ballot measure approved overwhelmingly by Massachusetts voters Tuesday will lead to more spacious cages for a few thousand hens in the state. But it could have effects on farms and the living quarters of chickens, pigs and calves across the nation. Question 3, which was approved by 78 percent of voters in the state, prohibits farms in the state from confining any hen, breeding pig or calf raised for veal in a way that prevents the animal from \u201clying down, standing up, fully extending its limbs, or turning around freely.",
        "KABUL \u2014 Afghanistan\u2019s president on Wednesday welcomed home Sharbat Gulla, National Geographic\u2019s famed \u201cAfghan Girl,\u201d just hours after she was deported from Pakistan, the latest in the odyssey of the globally recognized refugee. Gulla\u2019s deportation came after a regional court in the Pakistani city of Peshawar convicted her on charges of carrying a forged Pakistani ID card and staying in the country illegally. The case has drawn international attention and criticism of Pakistani authorities over their perceived harsh treatment of Gulla \u2014 and other Afghans who Islamabad says will be expelled as illegal immigrants.",
        "NEW DELHI \u2014 Puja Sagar cannot read or write, but she makes sure her son, Gaurav, never misses school. However, Sagar, a frail but cook, is worried that he is not learning much at school, even though he is in the eighth grade \u2014 thanks mostly to a controversial policy under which even younger students cannot be held back at the end of a school year. \u201cEvery time I ask my son to read aloud, he stares blankly at the textbook for a long time,\u201d she said.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 The latest attraction in the German capital is an underground chamber about the size of a small living room, a devotional portrait of Frederick the Great hanging on the wall. An oxygen tank sits in one corner, suggesting its occupant\u2019s constant fear of suffocation. On a desk rests a small statue resembling his beloved German shepherd, Blondi. The new exhibit is a of the study in Adolf Hitler\u2019s bunker, the space where the 20th century\u2019s most notorious tyrant spent his final days before taking his life with a gunshot to the head.",
        "Donald Trump and President Obama met for the first time Thursday and pledged to work together, starting the whirlwind transition that will unfold over the next 10 weeks until Trump is sworn into office Jan. 20. Trump later met with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) at the Capitol and said they also would work together \u2014 but on Republican goals that are opposed by Obama and his fellow Democrats. \u201dWe\u2019re going to lower taxes,\u201d Trump told reporters, with Ryan seated by his side.",
        "Michelle Obama carried on an awkward White House tradition when she hosted Melania Trump for tea Thursday. It was their first meeting, coming on the heels of the ugliest campaign in recent history. They talked about raising children and took a tour of the White House\u2019s private residence before heading to the Oval Office to meet with the president and . The tour also included a visit to the Truman Balcony, which overlooks the South Lawn, and a tour of the State Floor of the executive mansion with the White House curator. Mrs.",
        "Washington began its transition of power Wednesday as the ascendancy of Donald Trump promised a seismic shift in nearly every facet of the capital city, from military and executive agencies to federal courts and financial and political establishments. President Obama, who had denounced Trump as unfit to serve as commander in chief, struck a conciliatory note in the Rose Garden of the White House, vowing to work with his successor to ensure a peaceful transfer. The two men, who spoke by phone early Wednesday morning, plan to meet Thursday."
