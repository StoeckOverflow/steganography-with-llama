        "The Justice Department is set to significantly shift its priorities under Donald Trump, reflecting the themes of a presidential candidate who consistently described the country as riven by chaos and in need of more powerful law enforcement. The department, which under President Obama built an aggressive civil rights division, is likely to take a more approach toward police departments alleged to have overused force and loosen restrictions on surveillance in Muslim communities, according to legal analysts and Trump\u2019s public statements.",
        "The Dow Jones industrial average reached a record high on Wednesday amid growing hopes that Donald Trump would deliver major stimulus to the economy. The index rose 218 points, or 1. 2 percent, to close at 18, 808, while the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 also gained. Among the factors driving the rally were bets on infrastructure stocks such as Caterpillar, whose share price has jumped nearly 20 percent over the past two days.",
        "In the wreckage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s unexpected loss, liberal lawmakers and advocacy groups have started plotting a major overhaul of the Democratic National Committee, with the aim of using the staid organization to reconnect the party with voters it lost to Donald Trump. Much of the talk since Tuesday\u2019s election has focused on selecting a new chairman, with the most frequently mentioned successor being Rep. Keith Ellison ( .) a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who backed the primary bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( . ).",
        "Few Americans knew the voters who rejected Hillary Clinton better than her husband. He lived among them growing up, and then studied them with a fanatical intensity during his political rise. But now, with any notion of a dynasty dead and gone, one explanation for the stunning political demise of the Clintons might be the extent to which they moved away from a sensibility into the realm of the coastal elite, from McDonald\u2019s to veganism to put it in symbolic terms, making it harder for Hillary to bridge the nation\u2019s yawning social divide.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 The surprise triumph of Donald Trump is raising fears of a historic recalibration between the United States and its allies in Europe, threatening to upend the allegiances that became the cornerstone of War II peace. Few countries are more in the crosshairs than Germany, Western Europe\u2019s most populist nation and the pacifist home to 47, 000 U. S. troops. For decades, American power has been a security blanket here. Even as thousands of U. S.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian government officials conferred with members of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign team, a senior Russian diplomat said Thursday, a disclosure that could reopen scrutiny of the Kremlin\u2019s role in the \u2019s bitter race against Hillary Clinton. The statement came from Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who said in an interview with the Interfax news agency that \u201cthere were contacts\u201d with the Trump team. \u201cObviously, we know most of the people from his entourage,\u201d Ryabkov said.",
        "It\u2019s been 36 hours (or so) since we were all witnesses to the biggest political upset in presidential history. As Donald Trump and President Obama huddle in Washington on Thursday, and as the gears of the incoming government begin to grind in earnest, I\u2019m still totally captivated by the \u201chow\u201d of this election. How did this happen and what can we learn about ourselves and the country as a result?",
        "Asra Q. Nomani is a former Wall Street Journal reporter and a of the Muslim Reform Movement. She can be found on Twitter at @AsraNomani. A lot is being said now about the \u201csilent secret Trump supporters. \u201d This is my confession \u2014 and explanation: I \u2014 a a Muslim, an immigrant woman \u201cof color\u201d \u2014 am one of those silent voters for Donald Trump.

In the places I go \u2014 the \u201cbubble,\u201d I am constantly admonished \u2014 the feeling of grief persists, although it is being challenged by the advice to move on, to embrace defeat as if it were not, in fact, defeat, and strive for unity. I will do so, I promise, but I will not do so unilaterally. My side did not wage a dirty campaign, racist and misogynistic and dishonest to boot. My side has nothing to apologize for \u2014 except ineptitude.",
        "Republicans in Congress who vigorously opposed Donald Trump\u2019s run for president are now preparing to work with the incoming Trump administration on a number of foreign policy and national security issues where their policies overlap. First on their agenda is drastically increasing sanctions on Iran. \u201cThere are several issues that I can work with the new president on, the Iran deal being number one,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) who voted for independent candidate Evan McMullin, told me. \u201cTrump has been right about the Iran deal, it needs to be renegotiated.",
        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. The is at work on identifying appointees for his new administration. Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani have been floated as possibilities for the role of attorney general. Neither appointment would serve the work we most need at the Justice Department: a restoration of impartiality, fairness, nonpartisanship and thoroughgoing avoidance of conflicts and the appearance of conflict.",
        "We don\u2019t know much yet about what Donald Trump will do as president, but the barest outlines of his agenda are coming into view. It seems clear that Trump will pursue tax cuts, including big ones for top earners and businesses; deregulation across the board in areas such as finance; the repeal of Obamacare; more immigration policies; and more spending in two specific areas \u2014 infrastructure and the military. Which raises the possibility of a nightmare scenario for economic progressivism.",
        "We \u2014 Republicans and Democrats, and \u2014 are all adapting to a political thunder strike we never thought would come to pass, the election of Donald Trump as our 45th president. Yesterday, we spoke to Democrats who are understandably fearful and just plain lost. (If any Republican doubts the other side\u2019s devotion to country, look at how worried they are not about themselves, but about America.) The shock is nearly as great on the Republican side of the ledger. What can they do? How can they cope? 1.",

Some other women went there, too, weaving between the headstones of Congressional Cemetery in the nation\u2019s capital, finding the tombstone of the feminist pioneer tucked between a pair of tall Italian cypress trees. They left their \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers for Lockwood, who became the first woman to appear as an official candidate on a presidential ballot back in 1884, when she wasn\u2019t even allowed to vote in the election.",
        "President Obama has ordered the Pentagon to find and kill the leaders of an group in Syria that the administration had largely ignored until now and that has been at the vanguard of the fight against the Syrian government, U. S. officials said. The decision to deploy more drones and intelligence assets against the militant group formerly known as Jabhat reflects Obama\u2019s concern that it is turning parts of Syria into a new base of operations for on Europe\u2019s southern doorstep, the officials said.",
        "Lung cancer, which kills almost 160, 000 Americans a year, is among the cruelest of foes. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, undergo punishing chemotherapy and still have a bleak prognosis. More than half die within a year. Bit by bit, though, scientists are making progress against the nation\u2019s biggest cancer killer. Years ago, they began approaching lung cancer as many different diseases rather than a single one. The 15 percent of patients with certain mutations, for example, today get \u201ctargeted\u201d medications that work better than chemo.",
        "Aaron Schock, a former Illinois congressman whose Capitol Hill office was decorated in the style of the TV show \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d and whose abs landed him on the cover of Men\u2019s Health, was indicted Thursday on charges that he misspent government and campaign money for his personal benefit. Schock, 35, had resigned from Congress last year amid reports of alleged improper spending. The Republican said in a statement that he did so \u201cin hopes of sparing loved ones the indignity of being questioned and harassed about unfounded allegations,\u201d but the government pursued him nonetheless.",

Smith suffered severe burns to his head, neck, back, shoulder and arm, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Miami Herald\u2019s David Neal.

        "Members of the Oath Keepers and others not affiliated with organized groups learn navigation skills during a tactical training session in Montana. (Jim ) In the early hours of Nov. 9, 2016, Donald Trump exceeded expectations in a stunning victory to become the 45th president of the United States.

        "Vice Mike Pence will replace New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition effort, a change that will cement the Indiana governor\u2019s influence over the incoming administration\u2019s policy and personnel. The transition announced Friday, will substantially dilute the influence of Christie and his closest aides, and add a conservative edge to the upper level of Trump\u2019s team. Rick Dearborn, the chief of staff to Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) a Trump loyalist and voice on immigration, will now serve as the transition\u2019s executive director, replacing chief of staff Richard Bagger.",
        "During the brief period since his election, Donald Trump has begun to revise his agenda in ways that conform more closely to the heart of Republican thinking in recent decades. On the presidential transition website, at greatagain. gov, antiabortion statements and policy positions have appeared that were not part of the campaign\u2019s platform. Other proposals have been deleted. Erasing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a set of policies long favored by conservatives remain at the core of the agenda.",
        "Donald Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the regulations it has put out under President Obama are \u201ca disgrace. \u201d He has vowed to roll back Obama\u2019s signature effort to reduce emissions, known as the Clean Power Plan, and to scrap a litany of other \u201cunnecessary\u201d rules, especially those imposed on the oil, gas and coal sectors.",
        "KENOSHA, Wis. \u2014 The day after the election, Bob Oldani parked himself at the Common Grounds coffee shop and talked to whoever came by. At 71, he had just cast his first Republican vote for president. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my wife,\u201d he joked, as he told anyone within earshot why he\u2019d backed Donald Trump. \u201cWe need a change in everything, and I hope he can do it,\u201d said Oldani, who\u2019d retired after years as a machinist. \u201cThis guy\u2019s a billionaire, so I\u2019m thinking he can say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s just get the job done.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s decision to leave his children in control of his fortune during his presidency was already an unusual and setup. And on Friday, it became even more so.

In that role, the trio will have input when it comes to the people Trump picks for key administration posts.",
        "Few prognosticators predicted a Donald Trump victory ahead of Tuesday night. Polls showed Hillary Clinton comfortably ahead, and much of America (chiefly the media) failed to anticipate the wave of support that propelled him to victory. But a Washington, D. C. professor insisted that Trump was lined up for a win \u2014 based on the idea that elections are \u201cprimarily a reflection on the performance of the party in power. \u201d Allan Lichtman uses a historically based system of what he calls \u201ckeys\u201d to predict election results ahead of time.",
        "Megyn Kelly writes in her forthcoming memoir that someone told Donald Trump in advance of the first Republican primary debate last year that she would begin with \u201ca very pointed question directed at him. \u201d The Fox News anchor does not say Trump knew the wording of the question \u2014 a point she reinforced on Twitter on Thursday night \u2014 but her book alleges that the at least knew the nature of her memorable opening inquiry about his temperament and the many nasty things he has said about women.",
        "THE AWKWARD first meeting, as years of bitter history simmer just beneath the surface. The protests by the hundreds and thousands in cities across a divided nation. And the accusatory @RealDonaldTrump tweet that breaks his public turn toward a more presidential tone. In the immediate aftermath of America\u2019s electoral November Surprise, the steps of \u201cpeaceful transition\u201d have already supplied an array of striking images. So what visuals are America\u2019s cartoonists supplying, as they help a nation bring this transition into focus?

        "The Republican Party resembles the man who told his psychiatrist, \u201cI have an identity problem, and so do I. \u201d The party\u2019s leader is at best indifferent to, and often is hostile to, much of the party\u2019s recent catechism: limited government, the rule of law, a restrained executive, fiscal probity, entitlement reforms, free trade, the general efficiency and equity of markets allocating wealth and opportunity, and \u2014 this matters especially \u2014 the importance of decorousness in political discourse.

        "Witnesses who tuned in to Donald Trump and Barack Obama\u2019s can\u2019t have missed the change in the \u2019s demeanor and affect. Quiet and reserved, he seemed almost chastened. Dare I say, humble and deferential to the man whose citizenship he challenged for years leading up to his candidacy. The real estate tycoon best known for ego, insults and invective seemed almost sensitive and earnest, as well as appropriately respectful toward the president and the rare circumstances in which he found himself. It was . . . odd. Was he drugged? Was he too exhausted to rally the showman?"
