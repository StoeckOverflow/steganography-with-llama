        "Herblock, the legendary Post cartoonist, spent decades depicting Richard Nixon as a sinister figure with a 5 o\u2019clock shadow. The day after the 1968 election, Herblock sat down to draw the cartoonist\u2019s office as a barbershop, a paper taped to the wall: \u201cThis shop gives to every new president of the United States a free shave. \u201d Signed, \u201cH.

        "FROM 2:50 a. m. Wednesday until 9:19 p. m. Thursday, Donald Trump was responsible, reassuring \u2014 downright presidential. With a single tweet, he then rekindled every legitimate fear of the damage he might do from the White House. And nine hours after that, the reversed course again \u2014 with a contradictory, and statesmanlike, message on Twitter. Whether the opposing messages revealed conflicts within Mr. Trump\u2019s team or within his soul is beyond our ability to judge. But which tendency wins out is a critical question for the country. The presidential Mr.",

Kaplan is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and author of \u201cEarning the Rockies: How Geography Shapes America\u2019s Role in the World,\u201d to be published in January. Donald Trump is being called a \u201crealist\u201d in foreign policy. Don\u2019t believe it. He may have some crude realist instincts, but that only makes him a terrible messenger for realism. Realists like myself should be very nervous about his election. Realism is a sensibility, not a specific guide to what to do in each crisis.",
        "The fundraiser invitation promised a night of \u201cCocktails and Virtual Reality. \u201d More than 40 people crowded into a Washington rowhouse, sipping mixed drinks in Mason jars before settling into folding chairs and adjusting the focus on their Oculus Rift goggles. For eight minutes, they traversed through a squalid camp that sprawled out in every direction. It has become home to about 120, 000 Rohingya Muslims in Burma who fled violence from Buddhist mobs four years ago.",
        "MOSUL, Iraq \u2014 Since pushing into Mosul a week ago, Iraqi commanders say their forces have been shaken by some of the most complex fighting they have ever encountered in battles against the Islamic State. It is a bitter fight: street to street, house to house, with the presence of civilians slowing the advancing forces. Car bombs \u2014 the militants\u2019 main weapon \u2014 scream out of garages and straight into advancing military convoys. \u201cIf there were no civilians, we\u2019d just burn it all,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Sami a counterterrorism commander.",
        "Earlier this afternoon, my Facebook account displayed a beautiful message to my friends, asking them to \u201cremember\u201d me and \u201cfind comfort in the things others share\u201d about me. It was really touching; there was a little drawing of a flower. The thing is, I\u2019m not dead. Many other people were reporting on Friday afternoon that the same thing happened to them. \u201cFor a brief period today, a message meant for memorialized profiles was mistakenly posted to other accounts,\u201d A Facebook spokesman said in an emailed statement, \u201cthis was a terrible error that we have now fixed.",
        "The uprisings that became known as the Arab Spring were sparked in December 2010, when a young Tunisian fruit seller set himself on fire in response to harassment from police officers. Within months, huge protests had spread throughout the Arab world, taking down autocratic governments in four countries but also sparking horrific civil wars and giving fuel to religious and sectarian extremism in the region.",
        "The Pentagon has tracked scores of Islamic State militants escaping fierce fighting in Libya\u2019s coastal city of Sirte and has begun laying the groundwork for expanded air attacks to follow and kill them, part of a final push by the Obama administration to blunt multiplying militant threats across the broader Middle East. Intelligence from surveillance aircraft flying over Sirte and areas south of the city allowed the U. S. military\u2019s Africa Command to track up to several hundred militants who U. S. officials now fear could be preparing to mount a counter attack on allied Libyan forces.",
        "President Obama laid a wreath in Arlington National Cemetery on Friday and used his final Veterans Day speech to deliver a plea for unity and to urge Americans to set aside political grievances and follow the example of those who fight the country\u2019s wars. \u201dWe can practice kindness, we can pay it forward, we can volunteer, and we can serve,\u201d Obama said on a blustery and bright day. \u201dWe can respect one another.

        "Ankitha Konanki was waiting outside her third ATM of the day in Mumbai, hoping against hope she\u2019d finally be able to score some money after three days of being totally cashless. Things got so bad she had to beg the cafeteria at her school to let her open a charge account to buy lunch. \u201dThere are such long queues everywhere!

        "Nowhere did Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy inspire more trepidation or alarm than in the national security community, inhabited by many Republicans who vehemently denounced their party\u2019s nominee as dangerously unfit to be commander in chief. Now, as Trump begins assembling his government, scores of former senior national security officials, foreign policy specialists and career civil servants are wrestling with a dilemma: refuse government service or join the administration of the 45th president?",
        "We don\u2019t know a whole heckuva lot about who Donald Trump will pick for his Cabinet at this point. So far, the process is heavy on rumors and preliminary lists. For Trump, selecting and vetting his picks isn\u2019t a process, nor should we expect much of it to be done in public. It\u2019s also important to emphasize upfront that names floated for various positions are sometimes more about expressing gratitude to surrogates, even if they\u2019re unlikely to actually get picked.",
        "The battle for Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is underway, and there\u2019s nothing orderly about it. Washington is rife with rumor, speculation and trepidation. The rest of the country is in the dark and divided. Trump always said he liked to be unpredictable, and so it is left to others right now to imagine how all the conflicts, contradictions and questions will be resolved. Two signs of the absence of clarity came Friday when Trump reshuffled the leadership of his transition team, jettisoning New Jersey Gov.",
        "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The increasingly tense protests around the country in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election escalated early Saturday with a shooting here that left one man hospitalized and scattered panicked protesters. Portland police said the shooter had no connection to the protesters, but after the fourth straight night of demonstrations in response to Trump\u2019s unexpected victory, city and police officials here appeared harried and frustrated. At a news conference Saturday afternoon, they told protesters to \u201cstay home. \u201d Mayor Charlie Hales said Portland has experienced \u201cgreat unrest\u201d since Tuesday night.",
        "Behind the barber\u2019s chair where Claude Rasnake diagnoses many of the world\u2019s problems, he charted the list of the Trump administration. Social Security, Medicare, the tax code \u2014 maybe Trump and a Republican Congress can finally get them fixed. Dismantle Obamacare and fix roads and bridges, too. But all that comes later, after the top priority. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019d like him to do is fire that lady that runs the EPA,\u201d Rasnake, 81, said, working the trimmer around a customer\u2019s ear.

        "Hillary Clinton blamed the renewed FBI inquiry into her State Department email system for blunting her momentum in the presidential election and the closure of that inquiry two days before Election Day for energizing voters for Donald Trump. \u201cThere are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,\u201d Clinton told top donors on a farewell conference call Saturday. \u201cBut our analysis is that [FBI Director James B.] Comey\u2019s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum,\u201d she said.",
        "Oil drillers. Gas pipelines. Coal. Banks. Pharmaceuticals. Construction and industrial equipment. The defense industry. Those are among the likely winners of a Donald Trump administration that could take the lid off coal and fracking regulations, begin an extensive repair of the nation\u2019s roads and bridges, rebuild defense, repeal the financial reform act and kill the Affordable Care Act. One big loser? Foreign trade could suffer if the follows through on his plan to renegotiate trade agreements. Trump joins only a handful of presidents who have entered the Oval Office with a strong background as a business executive or entrepreneur.",
        "After reiterating his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Donald Trump has indicated that he may keep two of the law\u2019s most popular provisions. One is straightforward enough \u2014 children up to age 26 being allowed to stay on their parents\u2019 plan. The other \u2014 preventing insurance companies from denying coverage because of preexisting conditions \u2014 offers a perfect illustration of why Trump and most of the other Republicans critics of Obamacare don\u2019t understand the health insurance market.",
        "Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore met with protesters Saturday afternoon at Trump Tower in Manhattan, saying he wanted to talk with Donald Trump. And he made it all the way to the fourth floor before Secret Service agents turned him away. Moore said later that he left a note that agents told him they would deliver to Trump. \u201dYou lost,\u201d Moore said the note read. \u201dStep aside.\u201d The liberal activist and outspoken critic of Trump was one of the few to predict Trump would win the election.",

        "The ascendancy of Donald Trump is surprising, but it is not shocking. How could this have happened? Easily. We are not a society of angels. The poisons that Trump peddles have been loose in the land for a long time. For decades the Republican Party has played with this fire with increasing recklessness, until finally it surrendered to the ravaging flame. There was never anything \u201cunimaginable\u201d about the nasty furies that carried this repulsive demagogue to the White House; more precisely, liberals appear to have suffered yet again from a failure of imagination.",

        "MOON TOWNSHIP, PA. \u2014 Gov. Mike Pence stood on the tarmac at Atlantic Aviation after one of the campaign\u2019s last rallies and told me about the goals of a Trump administration. \u201cIt all begins with Donald Trump\u2019s contract with the American voter,\u201d he said. Pence discussed tax reform, ethics reform, infrastructure improvements, better trade deals and a cheaper replacement for Obamacare. No mention of building walls, rounding up illegal immigrants or banning Muslims. Was he just playing the role of grace and steadiness to contrast Trump\u2019s more outrageous rhetoric? Maybe.",
        "When I arrived in Tampa for my Republican National Convention in 2012, I was enchanted. I met Jeb Bush and attended a panel on education and school choice. Kevin Johnson, the Democratic mayor of Sacramento, spoke alongside Bush, who talked about how his educational policies in Florida were focused on helping minorities find quality education, regardless of Zip code. There I was, listening to this bipartisan conversation focused on helping poor youths empower themselves and excel. There were no dog whistles and no racial innuendo \u2014 just good genuine policy focused on giving those in need a hand up.",
        "Democracy is one of the most cherished features of our nation. But we have many misconceptions about what it is, how much of it we have, how it works and what place it occupies in history. Perhaps more than at any time in recent American history, democracy is now a subject of debate, as populist movements abroad and at home prompt questions about the rule of the many. The United States has just finished one of the most divisive campaigns in recent history, and there is no sign yet that consensus is on the way.",
        "Pediatricians around the country, faced with persistent opposition to childhood vaccinations, are increasingly grappling with the difficult decision of whether to dismiss those families from their practices to protect their other patients. Doctors say they are more willing to take this step because the movement in recent years has contributed to a resurgence of preventable childhood diseases such as measles, mumps and whooping cough. Their practices also have been emboldened by families who say they will only choose physicians who require other families to vaccinate. But the decision is ethically fraught.",
        "PARIS \u2014 Nov. 13, 2015, has already gone down as the darkest day in French history since World War II, when 130 people were killed here in an Islamic State assault on daily life: a concert, a soccer game and cafes.

It is really sad,\u201d Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley said in a recorded statement about the attack, noting that he had seen video of the incident.
