        "American higher education has been seen for generations as an engine of opportunity to spur social mobility. But now social class is increasingly a roadblock to graduating from college. Whether students drop out of school is almost entirely dependent on one factor: their parents\u2019 income. Children from families who earn more than $90, 000 a year have a 1 in 2 chance of getting a bachelor\u2019s degree by age 24, but that falls to a 1 in 17 chance for those earning less than $35, 000.",
        "Comfort takes many forms: a cup of hot cocoa, a furry pet on your lap, a warm blanket. And of course, there\u2019s comfort food \u2014 be it a plate of pasta or a bowl of chicken soup, a pile of cookies or a pint of ice cream. Perhaps we\u2019re comforted because it\u2019s what we ate as children, or maybe because we think we deserve it. After all, how often do you reach for an austere salad in times of turmoil? I know I reach for a grilled cheese. What comforts one person doesn\u2019t always do the trick for others.",
        "Q: My son, who is 4, is on a local soccer team with kids ages 4 to 6. He was hesitant to engage during practices, but he got over that and can now participate without becoming too distracted or needing too much correction. When he faces other teams, however, he seems to get a little overwhelmed and refuses to play. I just have him stay on the sidelines with me. The coach comes around and asks whether he is ready, and he still doesn\u2019t want to play.",
        "Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, according to Trump\u2019s campaign. In choosing Priebus, 44, Trump has tapped a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the Republican Party. Priebus was recommended by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) and will be a bridge between the White House and the Congress, as well as the heads of Cabinet agencies. The choice signals Trump\u2019s willingness to work within the very establishment he assailed on the campaign trail.",

        "LONDON \u2014 Not long before Americans shocked the world by selecting Donald Trump to be their next president, a wealthy Brazilian businessman who played a boss on television became mayor of South America\u2019s largest city.

        "NEW HAVEN, Conn. \u2014 Among America\u2019s demoralized Democrats, none were more stunned at Donald Trump\u2019s electoral victory than those at the nation\u2019s college campuses who had expected to rejoice at the rise of the first female president.

        "Donald Trump sailed to victory in significant part on the back of white, rural, largely conservative voters drawn to his populist message. The upset victory has prompted in the media, which had set the odds of a Hillary Clinton victory from 71 percent to more than than 99 percent. \u201cWant to know what America\u2019s thinking?

        "The race to be the next head of the Democratic National Committee has quickly turned into a proxy fight between liberals and establishment types about where the party needs to go in the wake of Hillary Clinton\u2019s stunning loss at the hands of Donald Trump on Tuesday.
