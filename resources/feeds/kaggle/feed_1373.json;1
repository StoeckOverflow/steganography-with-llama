        "Gwen Ifill, who covered politics for some of the country\u2019s premier newspapers before transitioning to broadcast journalism and making her greatest mark as one of the most prominent TV anchors of her generation, died Nov. 14 at a hospice center in Washington. She was 61. The cause was endometrial cancer, said her brother, Roberto Ifill. Her ill health led to recent leaves of absence from her jobs as of \u201cThe PBS NewsHour\u201d and as moderator of PBS\u2019s \u201cWashington Week\u201d roundtable public affairs show.",
        "Lawrence Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010. Following a brief market plunge, the \u2019s speech last Tuesday night was more conciliatory than many expected and emphasized his commitment to infrastructure investment. Investors have, on balance, concluded that the combination of a shift to very expansionary fiscal policy and major reductions in regulation in sectors ranging from energy to finance to drug pricing will raise demand and reflate the U. S. economy.",
        "A week later, America is still struggling to understand what produced last Tuesday\u2019s election stunner, but here\u2019s one factor that\u2019s too little discussed: Hillary Clinton\u2019s relentless (and in my view, accurate) attacks on Donald Trump\u2019s character may actually have made his supporters more entrenched. One of my closest high school friends drove home this point in a message last Thursday, as the country was struggling to process the election results. \u201cAs a traditional Christian, I felt attacked, myself \u2014 not implicitly, but explicitly \u2014 during the entire election cycle,\u201d he emailed me.",
        "Following Dave Chappelle\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d monologue in which he said he was going to give Donald Trump a chance, there was one other statement this weekend that makes me think I may want to do the same. In a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview last night filled with substantive news, a seemingly casual question from Lesley Stahl elicited a potentially revealing answer from Trump. Stahl, directing her query to Melania Trump, asked if she was prepared for the level of scrutiny and loss of privacy that being first lady entails. Mrs.",
        "During their private White House meeting on Thursday, Mr. Obama walked his successor through the duties of running the country, and Mr. Trump seemed surprised by the scope, said people familiar with the meeting. Trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the West Wing had to be replaced at the end of Mr. Obama\u2019s term. After meeting with Mr. Trump, the only person to be elected president without having held a government or military position, Mr. Obama realized the Republican needs more guidance.",
        "The left is aghast at the realization that President Donald Trump could actually follow through on his promise to \u201ccancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama\u201d on his first day in office. He should do it. Every president reverses some executive actions of the previous president. After President Obama took office in 2009, he revoked a series of executive orders issued by President George W.",
        "Like the country as a whole, Washington today is characterized by radically different emotions as it contemplates the upcoming Trump presidency. Republicans are gleeful about all they\u2019ll be able to do to roll back the progress of the past eight years, liberating the country from the cruel oppression of things such as expanded health insurance, regulations on Wall Street and reproductive rights. Liberals are horrified at the same prospect. And members of the media are looking desperately for signs that Donald Trump is not actually the person we all watched for the past year and a half.",
        "Chelsea Manning, an Army private convicted in 2013 of taking troves of secret diplomatic and military documents and disclosing them to WikiLeaks, has formally asked President Obama to commute her prison sentence to allow an immediate release and \u201ca first chance at life. \u201d Manning, 29, has served 6\u00bd years in federal custody \u2014 longer than any other person convicted of leaking classified information in U.

        "When President Obama arrives Tuesday in Europe, he will touch down in a country at the center of the continent\u2019s refugee crisis \u2014 Greece \u2014 before journeying to one that has helped guide the continent\u2019s response \u2014 Germany. The symbolic juxtaposition of the two countries underscores the balance Obama hopes to strike on his last trip to Europe as president. While he plans to buttress Greek efforts to cope with migrants fleeing the battlefields of the Middle East, he must contend with other European Union members\u2019 desire to keep more refugees out of their countries.",
        "The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force on Sunday issued new guidance for the use of statin drugs.

        "Twelve years ago, when J. Crew first started selling bridal gowns, it was an unusual gamble: Would women be willing to buy their wedding dresses \u2014 arguably the most glamorous frock they\u2019d ever wear \u2014 from a store that was known for sensible sweaters and blazers? The answer, the chain soon found out, was an emphatic \u201cyes. \u201d Women began flocking to the line, which, like J. Crew\u2019s everyday clothes, was more about classic elegance than shine and shimmer. These were minimalist silk column gowns and floaty, pieces, maybe with a small dash of sparkle around the waist.",

This train is not meant for ferrying passengers from city to city. Instead, its function is to bring precious medical care to India\u2019s rural residents. There are scant medical facilities in much of India, and many of the places where people can seek medical attention only have resources to provide basic care. Enter the Lifeline Express, otherwise known as the \u201cMagic Train of India. \u201d To some, the Lifeline Express is indeed magical.",
        "Donald Trump, who clashed with leading Republicans throughout his campaign, faced growing tumult in his national security transition team on Monday as key members of his own party appeared to question his views and personnel choices. Former congressman Mike Rogers ( .) a respected voice on national security thought to be a leading candidate to run the CIA, was among those pushed out of the team over the past two days, two individuals with direct knowledge said, in a series of moves that have added to the anxiety across the upper ranks of U.

        "Donald Trump has pledged to begin deporting millions of undocumented immigrants as soon as he takes office next year. For now, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck has no plans to help him do it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to maintain the same posture we always have,\u201d Beck told KNX 1070 Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t make detentions or arrests based solely on status, whether that\u2019s immigration status or any other status. \u201d \u201cIf the federal government takes a more aggressive role on deportation, then they\u2019ll have to do that on their own,\u201d he continued.",
        "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has been a confidant to Donald Trump since the end of the Republican primaries, is unlikely to join the administration but will remain an informal adviser. \u201cThe way I\u2019m leaning is to work from the outside and not from the inside,\u201d Carson said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post. \u201cI want to have the freedom to work on many issues and not be pigeonholed into one particular area.",

        "The ouster of former congressman Mike Rogers ( .) from Donald Trump\u2019s transition team is a worrisome sign of continuing internecine battles in the GOP and the ascendancy of Trump\u2019s personal political allies in shaping the \u2019s agenda. Rogers, a widely respected former FBI agent who headed the House Intelligence Committee, had been seen as a figure of stability and continuity in intelligence matters.

        "Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality. It was gratifying that after Wisconsin voted him into the presidency, the gentleman did not talk about putting Hillary Clinton in prison. That was a nice surprise. And when he met with Obama of Kenya, the white sahib was listened to what the African had to say, did not interrupt or call him stupid, and in fact thanked the alien for meeting with him.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s extensive business network in the United States and overseas is unprecedented \u2014 and problematic \u2014 for someone moving into the Oval Office. Ordinarily, a president would put his holdings in a blind trust, providing reassurance to voters that no official decisions will be taken to benefit himself financially. It\u2019s not clear how much reassurance that could provide in this case, given that there\u2019s no hiding the Trump hotels and golf courses that make up much of his holdings. The only foolproof way to avoid conflicts would be for Mr.",

He\u2019s a pragmatic populist. \u201d With those words, Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, momentarily lifted the pall that has come over me since the historic election that has given us Donald Trump. Perhaps the man who ran a racist, xenophobic and misogynistic campaign that freely dabbled in lies won\u2019t actually govern that way.
