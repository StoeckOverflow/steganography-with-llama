        "SAFIYA, Iraq \u2014 Blindfolded and bound, his knees pressing into the dirt, Imad resigned himself to what seemed inevitable: He was going to die. Islamic State gunmen had driven him and about 90 other former Iraqi police and army officers to a remote industrial area on the edge of Hamam 10 miles south of Mosul, after rounding them up from their villages last month. Iraqi security forces were approaching, and the militants were losing their grip on the area.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 The Middle East is bracing for an incoming American president who seems intent on radically reordering the regional balance of power, heralding new uncertainty and perhaps new turmoil for a part of the world already engulfed in multiple wars. So vague and contradictory were many of the pronouncements made by Donald Trump on the campaign trail that governments and analysts are puzzling out which ones he meant and how he would be able to implement them all.",
        "As Iraqi troops slowly push into Mosul backed by heavy airstrikes, artillery and Western advisers, the Islamic State is not only fighting back conventionally but also with slick propaganda footage showing its prowess on the battlefield. A video, posted Monday, has all the hallmarks of Islamic State films of its summary executions: footage and solid production. The video also uses drone footage to show the charred wreckage of Iraqi military vehicles and the U. S. equipment that the group plucked from them. Militants appear to drag a U. S. grenade launcher from the wreckage of a destroyed Iraqi Humvee.",
        "Police in Oklahoma City said that one person was fatally shot at the airport Tuesday afternoon, prompting officials to close the airport and urge people there to shelter in place. Capt. Paco Balderrama, a spokesman for the Oklahoma City police, said that authorities got a call at about 1:30 p. m. local time about shots fired in the parking lot area of Will Rogers Airport. He said authorities also believe there was a second reported victim of the shooting. \u201cWe have one victim confirmed,\u201d Balderrama in a briefing with reporters shortly before 2 p. m. local time.",
        "Statins are one of the biggest success stories of modern medicine, credited with transforming cardiac care. Millions of Americans take them based on scientific evidence that it reduces their risk of heart attack and stroke, but the drugs are not for everyone. There has been considerable debate about the balance of potential risk and benefit, and a significant percentage of those who take statins have complained of side effects such as muscle pain and cognitive effects like fuzzy memory. And so the search has been on for a new \u2014 and better \u2014 class of medication.",
        "The twins were okay. LaKira Johnson could hear a doctor confirm that as she slid a wand over her bulging belly during an ultrasound. They were kicking. Their heartbeats were strong. LaKira imagined them in there playing, oblivious to the senseless shooting that had left her bleeding that night on the dirty tile floor of a carryout place. She\u2019d just wanted a sandwich. Five months pregnant and craving a cheesesteak, LaKira had walked from her home in Northeast Washington to Jerry Chan\u2019s restaurant on an August night.",
        "In 1819, well after helping to found the United States of America, Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. It was the state\u2019s first true public university. Known as the \u201cFather of the University of Virginia,\u201d Jefferson was laid to rest at his home in Monticello, less than 10 miles from his school. Jefferson embodied the contradictions of his time. He was a slave owner, who wrote \u201call men are created equal\u201d in the Declaration of Independence. But Martin Luther King Jr. for example, regularly evoked Jefferson\u2019s words in his speeches. On Sept.",
        "Women waiting for cataract surgery. (Jordi Pizzaro) There is a different kind of train that you might see traveling deep into India\u2019s rural areas. This train is not meant for ferrying passengers from city to city. Instead, its function is to bring precious medical care to India\u2019s rural residents. There are scant medical facilities in much of India, and many of the places where people can seek medical attention only have resources to provide basic care. Enter the Lifeline Express, otherwise known as the \u201cMagic Train of India. \u201d To some, the Lifeline Express is indeed magical.",
        "Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to push back against news coverage describing a chaotic transition to power, saying the process of selecting Cabinet secretaries and working with the Obama administration \u201cis going so smoothly. \u2019\u2019 As Trump met with senior advisers to discuss potential Cabinet candidates, there were further signs that power in his transition effort was consolidating within an group of loyalists generally not aligned with Republican members of the Washington establishment. Among them is Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) a top Trump adviser known for his views on immigration.",
        "ORLANDO \u2014 Republican governors, including some who feuded with Donald Trump during the bitter presidential campaign, say they are bullish on his prospects to deliver what he has promised but warn that he must maintain his discipline and move quickly. Gathering for the first time since last week\u2019s upset election, members of the Republican Governors Association (RGA) said that Trump\u2019s win will be a boon for them as well. \u201cWe\u2019re headed in the right direction,\u201d Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Wednesday at the closing public session of the conference. \u201cI think there\u2019s a road map. \u201d Texas Gov.",
        "Donald Trump vilified and condemned reporters when he was a candidate. As for the past week, he seems to have moved on to simply ignoring them. Defying the usual presidential press protocols, Trump has twice in the past week ditched the pool of reporters who follow him in public. The latest incident occurred Tuesday night, when reporters were led to believe by his staff that he had retired for the night \u2014 only to learn that he was at dinner with his family at a restaurant in New York.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Happy hour had just started in the Trump Bar, just off the lobby of Trump Tower, and nearly every seat was filled in the formerly sleepy establishment. A couple sipped $10 martinis as a red campaign hat sat on the bar next to them. A group of guys with $5 beers filled a table, all of their bodies turned toward the four gold elevators in the lobby.",
        "Vice President Biden and his wife, Jill, hosted Vice Mike Pence and his family for lunch at the Naval Observatory on Wednesday, a gathering that culminated in Biden pledging to be \u201cavailable to him \u201d after leaving office. The which included Pence\u2019s wife, Karen, and daughter Charlotte, featured a tour of the house and grounds that the Pences will occupy starting Jan. 20. Afterward, Pence told reporters he had received a \u201cCook\u2019s tour\u201d of the residence and appreciated the Bidens\u2019 hospitality.",
        "We might as well start with Ivanka, as we plumb the present and future of Trumpism, the Trump Cabinet, the Trump family, the Trump brand. Because \u2014 Ivanka. The most personable, palatable, fashionable, member of the future first family. The most inscrutable, yet most weirdly relatable. Some people think she\u2019ll be the real first lady, with her telegenic personality and her copacetic pet causes, and her lifestyle website, already dedicated to being a gracious host and professional woman.",
        "Seventeen days before President Donald Trump, his spoken oath of office still lingering in the wintry air, lifts his left hand from scripture (a edition of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d) the Congress will begin working. Fittingly, on Jan. 3, the \u201cfirst branch\u201d of government will go first, flexing its somewhat atrophied Article I muscles. When Trump reaches his desk on the morning of Jan. 21, he should find there two congressional measures emblematic of how quickly elections can have consequences. One should be the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re on the same page with our \u201d Paul Ryan said this week. If he believes that, the young House speaker may be in need of a pair of Foster Grants. On Wednesday afternoon, House Republicans from the Freedom Caucus assembled for the first time since the election for the monthly \u201cConversations with Conservatives. \u201d In one hour, they served up enough disputes to last four years. They differed with Donald Trump on a massive infrastructure bill that isn\u2019t funded by cuts elsewhere in the government.",
        "Our country needs a new era of bipartisanship \u2014 but not the kind you are probably thinking of, and not, I fear, the kind we are likely to get. Barely a week after Donald Trump secured his majority, we are confronted with a series of abuses that would be unacceptable from any other Republican or Democrat. In the coming months and years, members of both parties who honor our constitutional rights and our shared ethical standards need to band together in what you might call the Alliance for the Republic to defend basic norms and resist their violation.",
        "If they gave Pulitzer Prizes for pithiness, journalist Salena Zito\u2019s analytical couplet on the surprise winner of Campaign 2016 would get one. The press took Republican Donald Trump \u201cliterally, but not seriously,\u201d she wrote, whereas Trump\u2019s supporters took him \u201cseriously, but not literally. \u201d Exactly. Hence it was disappointing, after a week in which he had otherwise epitomized calm statesmanship, to hear that President Obama doesn\u2019t get Zito\u2019s point. Of Trump, the president opined: \u201cI don\u2019t think he is ideological. I think ultimately he\u2019s pragmatic in that way. \u201d In other words, Obama takes the neither literally nor seriously.",
        "THE MORNING after Donald Trump\u2019s election as president, a student at Baylor University had a nasty, encounter on her way to class. A native of Zambia, she was called the by another student, who shoved her off the sidewalk and said he was \u201cjust trying to make America great again,\u201d the signature slogan of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. What is perhaps most appalling about the incident is that it was not isolated. Rather, it was part of a rising number of acts of intolerance against minorities, women and religious groups that have followed Mr. Trump\u2019s election.",
        "A week after the highest of all glass ceilings proved indestructible, a congressional panel finds the country needs a national museum dedicated to showcasing the contributions and experiences of American women. To be called the American Museum of Women\u2019s History, the institution would open in a new or existing building on or near the Mall and would be operated by the Smithsonian Institution. Private donors would provide the estimated $150 million to $180 million needed for the construction or renovation. \u201cIt\u2019s long overdue, and D. C. visitors deserve to be inspired by stories of women,\u201d U. S. Rep.",
        "Over the weekend images surfaced online of a Hezbollah parade in Qusair, Syria, featuring U. S. armored personnel carriers affixed with antiaircraft guns. The images prompted a flurry of speculation about the vehicles\u2019 origin and whether the group had pilfered the stocks of the U. S. Lebanese military. The armored personnel carrier, known as the M113, is one of the United States\u2019 most ubiquitous armored vehicles and has been in service since the 1960s.",
        "About a after the Washington Nationals season came to its end, Max Scherzer\u2019s pitching eye and eye blazed wide, united in a devastated daze. \u201cIt was a good pitch,\u201d he said, reliving the pitch the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 Joc Pederson hit out to tie the decisive Game 5, his last pitch of the 2016 season. \u201cRight on the black. \u201d Scherzer then shook his head and turned to his locker, left to an offseason of wondering why his best stuff was not good enough when he needed it most.",
        "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan on Wednesday indicted Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the man accused of planting two bombs in New York City in September, one of which exploded and injured more than 30 people. Rahimi, 28, of Elizabeth, N. J. could face a mandatory life sentence. Rahimi was also charged in September by federal prosecutors in New Jersey with setting off a bomb along the course of a Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Park. Investigators also found explosive devices in a backpack left by Rahimi at a New Jersey train station.",
        "Vicki Vanilla. Susie Sausage. Buncho Bananas. If these names sound like gibberish to you now, consider yourself warned: There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll soon be on a frantic hunt to get them under your Christmas tree. These tiny, plastic characters are part of an explosively growing line of toys called Shopkins, which can perhaps best be described as personified versions of items you\u2019d find at the grocery store or the mall \u2014 miniature pastries or high heels with cute faces.",
        "Prosecutors in Minnesota said Wednesday that they had charged a police officer with manslaughter for fatally shooting Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a Twin Cities suburb over the summer. The shooting\u2019s aftermath was broadcast on Facebook Live by Diamond Reynolds, Castile\u2019s girlfriend, footage that quickly spread across social media and cable news, making it one of the most fatal police shootings during the protests that have occurred across the country in recent years.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 When Kim became South Korea\u2019s first democratically elected civilian president in 1993, he vowed to cure the country of the \u201cKorean disease,\u201d the political corruption that had become endemic. Kim oversaw an ambitious drive to clean up the country, even authorizing the arrest of his two immediate predecessors on charges, although he eventually became infected by the \u201cdisease\u201d himself when his son was arrested on corruption and bribery charges.",
        "For a few bleary seconds after she woke up, everything felt the same. Same bed, same house, same town, same Cathy Mousseau, a Midwestern Methodist trying to live a life of love and kindness as another day began. Then she remembered. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said to herself. The president of the United States would be Donald Trump, who had called Mexicans rapists, proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States and spoken of grabbing women\u2019s crotches. Now it was the morning after, and Cathy looked outside, her eyes still red from crying. A glorious sunny day.",
        "Photographer Tamara Merino and her boyfriend were driving through the desert in Australia in November 2015 when they started to see a few odd signs: \u201cUnderground bar,\u201d then \u201cunderground restaurant. \u201d After they got a flat tire, they found an underground church \u2014 empty, but lit by a few flickering candles. They had stumbled into the city of Coober Pedy, a partly subterranean community and the opal capital of the world. The town\u2019s name comes from the Aboriginal phrase \u201ckupa piti,\u201d or, roughly, \u201cwhite man\u2019s hole.",
        "Donald Trump plans to meet this weekend with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a fierce critic during the campaign, to discuss his transition operation and a potential role as secretary of state, people close to the transition said Thursday. Trump\u2019s outreach to Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, could help bridge the divide between the \u2019s advisers and the GOP establishment, and send a signal to foreign capitals that Trump is interested in a more conventional figure as the nation\u2019s top diplomat.",
        "In the days after Donald Trump appointed a senior adviser to his White House staff, the League sent out a searing condemnation. The appointment of Stephen K. Bannon to a top White House job was an act \u201chostile to core American values,\u201d the group said. The more conservative Zionist Organization of America also mounted an attack. But its target was the ADL, which it accused of engaging in \u201ccharacter assassination. \u201d It has invited Bannon to speak at its annual gala in New York on Sunday."
