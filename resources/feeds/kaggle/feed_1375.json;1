        "The news, as always, came via Twitter. NBC News: Source close to Trump with direct knowledge of his thinking confirms Sunday\u2019s meeting with Romney is to discuss Secretary of State \u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) November 17, 2016 Mitt Romney, the face \u2014 and voice \u2014 of the resistance to Donald Trump in the Republican primary and the general election, will huddle with the over the weekend to talk about possibly serving as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. It\u2019s possible, of course, that this meeting is solely for show. After all, Trump isn\u2019t exactly someone who forgives and forgets.",
        "Former House speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday he will not serve in Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet. \u201cI want to be free to network across the whole system and look at what we have to do to succeed,\u201d Gingrich said when briefly reached by phone. Holding a Cabinet post would have been \u201cnot physically doable,\u201d he said. The remarks from the former GOP presidential candidate, 73, came after he told McClatchy he intends to focus on \u201cstrategic planning\u201d during the Trump administration rather than run a federal department.",
        "While it\u2019s pretty much a given that the Affordable Care Act won\u2019t survive a Trump presidency and Republican Congress in its current form, there are sweeping implications of reversing a law that has reached in so many ways into our health care system. The government has never undone a major benefits program after it has taken effect \u2014 and neither the incoming administration nor GOP lawmakers know exactly how they\u2019ll replace it.",
        "Last December, amid the jumbled Republican presidential nomination scrum, Donald Trump carved out a half an hour for a live video interview with a volcanic Austin radio and host who broadcasts from a location dubbed \u201cThe Central Texas Command Center and the Heart of the Resistance. \u201d Alex Jones, America\u2019s foremost purveyor of outlandish conspiracy theories, was in a buoyant mood that day. He\u2019d had Matt Drudge, the influential conservative news aggregator, on recently. But this was much bigger. Trump wasted no time signaling that his aligned with the host\u2019s.",
        "What do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they\u2019re all \u2014 and invented by the same man. Paul Horner, the impresario of a Facebook empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. He has twice convinced the Internet that he\u2019s British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. \u201cSouth Park\u201d lawsuit last year.",
        "The idea of a Muslim registry or Muslim database has been back in the news in recent days after a pair of Donald Trump supporters rekindled it. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach \u2014 a rumored potential pick for Trump\u2019s attorney general \u2014 talked to Reuters on Tuesday about the Trump administration implementing one. By Wednesday, Trump surrogate Carl Higbie cited Japanese American internment camps during World War II as \u201cprecedent\u201d for doing such a thing. Questions over the idea of creating a database of Muslim immigrants are coming up as Donald Trump forms his new administration.",
        "Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. said Thursday that he has submitted his letter of resignation to President Obama, cementing his plan to leave his job as the nation\u2019s spy chief when a new president is sworn in. \u201cI submitted my letter of resignation last night, which felt pretty good,\u201d Clapper said in testimony Thursday morning before the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cI have 64 days left and I would have a hard time with my wife for anything past that. \u201d U.

        "Well, it\u2019s official \u2014 the new word of 2016, according to Oxford Dictionaries, is \u201c . \u201d In this universe, where established facts often don\u2019t matter as much as appeals to emotion and partisan ideology, we also hear another word a lot: \u201cnormalize. \u201d The question behind the word is this: In covering Trump and his presidency, should the traditional news media treat this like any other transition, and like any other administration? People magazine embraced normalizing when it quickly put a glamorous, backlighted shot of Donald Trump on its cover last week.",
        "SEOUL Around the world, our allies are worried. Here in South Korea, Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected election victory has fueled a deep sense of uncertainty about the future of American leadership in Asia and the world. Government officials and foreign policy experts are scrutinizing every Trump utterance about South Korea, trade and security made during the campaign, and they don\u2019t like what they find. As I have been asked repeatedly during my stay here, does he really believe that the U. S.",

To read more of Patrick\u2019s opinion pieces, visit his blog, Gathara\u2019s World, or follow him on Twitter (@gathara). Trevor Noah, the South African comedian and host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d a popular news satire and talk show in the United States, once described Donald Trump as America\u2019s first African president.

        "Henry Olsen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and an adjunct professor at Villanova University. His book \u201cRonald Reagan: New Deal Republican\u201d is scheduled for publication next year. Donald Trump has won what might be the greatest \u201cchange election\u201d in decades. Republicans leaders are only now waking up to the fact that the change Trump\u2019s voters want will end up changing the GOP, too. Trump\u2019s voters were not voting for less government.",
        "CNN reports: Donald Trump will meet this weekend with one of his fiercest critics: 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, a senior Republican source told CNN on Thursday. The two men are set to meet this weekend to discuss \u201cgoverning moving forward\u201d and potentially a role for Romney in Trump\u2019s Cabinet, the source said. Before anyone gets excited, we think it highly, highly unlikely Romney would want to work for Trump or Trump would have him. If we have learned anything about Trump, it is that loyalty matters most.",
        "When the new Congress is sworn in and Donald Trump takes office in January, Republicans have a long list of legislative actions they want to take. Repeal the Affordable Care Act. Privatize (excuse me, \u201creform and strengthen\u201d) Medicare. Slash Medicaid. Cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations. Undo environmental protections. Make it harder for unions to organize. Repeal the law to unburden Wall Street from meddlesome oversight. Defund Planned Parenthood. Build a border wall. It\u2019s a veritable smorgasbord, and after eight years of a Democratic presidency, they are positively famished.",
        "Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. on Thursday said free speech and religious liberty hang in the balance at the Supreme Court and warned of other issues along the \u201cconstitutional fault lines\u201d that might confront the divided justices. A little more than a week ago, it seemed those issues would come before a court with a liberal majority for the first time in nearly half a century. Instead, the election of Donald Trump is likely to mean a restoration of the conservative majority that prevailed before the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February.",
        "Political people in the United States are watching the chaos in Washington in the moment. But some people in the science community are watching the chaos somewhere else \u2014 the Arctic. It\u2019s polar night there now \u2014 the sun isn\u2019t rising in much of the Arctic. That\u2019s when the Arctic is supposed to get when the sea ice that covers the vast Arctic Ocean is supposed to grow and thicken.",
        "A police officer in Arizona was placed on administrative leave this week after a video that shows him punching a woman in the face was posted online. The Flagstaff Police Department learned of the footage Wednesday evening and launched an internal investigation into the incident, which occurred earlier in the day, according to the department. \u201cDuring the arrest the female, who appears somewhat uncooperative, was struck in the face by the officer,\u201d police said in a news release. \u201cOur agency is very concerned by what is depicted in this video. \u201d The officer was identified as Jeff Bonar.",
        "Ruth Gruber, an American journalist who stumbled into one of the great rescue stories of the Holocaust when the U. S. government appointed her to escort nearly 1, 000 Jews across infested waters to the shores of the United States, died Nov. 17 at her home in Manhattan. She was 105. Her son David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, confirmed the death. In an era when many female reporters were writing for the social pages, Dr. Gruber, as a photographer and reporter, was a dynamic exception.",
        "IRBIL, Iraq \u2014 The listeners who call in to Radio Alghad are typical of audiences around the world. It\u2019s complain, complain. Except the callers to \u201cRadio Tomorrow\u201d are in the Islamic city of Mosul, and they don\u2019t want to yak about traffic or sports. They want to unload on suicide bombers and errant airstrikes, on the lack of food and medicine. They have questions about when to wave white flags and what to do with bodies in the rubble. \u201cShrapnel hit the tanks on the rooftop,\u201d a caller named Hasan told .5 the other day.",

        "Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) as attorney general and Rep. Mike Pompeo ( .) as CIA director, a pair of conservatives who offer early signs of the shape of Trump\u2019s Cabinet. Trump also confirmed the news reported a day earlier that he has selected retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as his national security adviser, a position that, unlike the other two, does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.",
        "In December, after presidential candidate Donald Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims\u201d entering the country, Sen. Patrick J.

Jeff Sessions ( .) \u2014 a member of the Judiciary Committee, along with Leahy \u2014 voted against the resolution and delivered a oration urging fellow senators to join him.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the CIA is a Kansas congressman who is widely respected for his intelligence but also seen as a fierce partisan on polarizing issues including the deaths of U. S. personnel in Benghazi, the leaks of Edward Snowden and the email controversy that engulfed Hillary Clinton. Rep. Mike Pompeo ( .) has used his perch on the House Intelligence Committee to attack major pillars of President Obama\u2019s foreign policy agenda, including the nuclear deal with Iran.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, among the most important jobs in the Trump administration, has said some pretty incendiary things on the Internet. Before being tapped to advise Trump on national security issues, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn was an intelligence officer and head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Obama until he was removed from his command in 2014 over his leadership style. Flynn went on to criticize some of his superiors, including Obama, regarding their stances on Islamist extremism.",
        "Donald Trump, who has repeatedly bragged he never settles lawsuits despite a long history of doing so, has agreed to a $25 million settlement to end the fraud cases pending against his defunct real estate seminar program, Trump University. The settlement eliminates the possibility that Trump will be called to testify in court in the midst of his presidential transition.",
        "In case there was any doubt, the last 24 hours have sealed it: Donald Trump\u2019s family will play a big role in his presidency, if they have anything to say about it. That\u2019s problematic for a host of reasons. But the Trumps appear primed to press the envelope of what\u2019s legal and ethical in the new administration. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, appeared in photos of the \u2019s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday.",
        "Senate Democrats are not going to be able to block Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions bid to become attorney general. And they can\u2019t do much to stop Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo from assuming the helm of the CIA. And they have only themselves to thank for it. That\u2019s because exactly three years ago, the Democratic Senate majority \u2014 led by Harry Reid (Nev.) \u2014 rammed through controversial rules fundamentally changing the way the Senate does business.",
        "During a conference call with analysts Thursday morning, Ford Motor Company Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was asked how Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies might affect the automaker\u2019s decisions on investing in Mexico or in the United States. Shanks said that he couldn\u2019t speculate on trade. He pivoted, instead, to Trump\u2019s plans to cut taxes and spend more on infrastructure, saying they could \u201cbuild a stronger, more vibrant, growing economy and provide an environment where it makes economic sense to build back up manufacturing jobs here.",
        "South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley upbraided the Republican establishment on Friday, arguing the party lost its way by ignoring anger and frustration, and that it must return to its core values of limited government and being a party for all people \u2014 including immigrants and people of color. Haley, speaking at the Federalist Society\u2019s National Lawyers Convention in Washington, offered some praise for Donald Trump, telling the crowd of conservative lawyers that while she was never Trump\u2019s \u201cbiggest cheerleader,\u201d the Republican Party has an unprecedented opportunity to enact conservative policies and must take advantage of Trump\u2019s election.",

They\u2019re vastly white. Many sprang from the private sector. Many represent Washington. (Check out the full list here.) This assembly, of course, is highly tentative. Trump is expected to pick 22 future leaders of the government by Inauguration Day, and we\u2019re still two months away. It\u2019s too early to say whether the next administration will be more or a total boy\u2019s club."
