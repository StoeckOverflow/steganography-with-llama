        "THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT owes its very existence to the struggle for greater equality in the United States, especially greater racial equality. Congress created it in 1870 largely for the purpose of enforcing laws designed to protect newly freed slaves in the South from the Ku Klux Klan and others who would deny them the franchise and civil rights. During the 1960s, the Justice Department stood at the forefront of federal efforts to make good on the promises to African Americans that it had failed to fulfill in the War era. Now Donald Trump has chosen Sen.",
        "What is a Christian? Now, hold on. The question isn\u2019t some roundabout attempt to use an opinion piece to promote or knock a particular faith. Rather, it spotlights a search of another kind. \u201cWhat is a Christian?\u201d grows out of an article this week by The Post\u2019s Julie Zauzmer, which described jubilation among some Christians over Donald Trump\u2019s victory \u2014 a win supported by more than 80 percent of white evangelicals. \u201cIt really makes you feel great to be a Christian,\u201d one person told The Post.",

        "AMERICANS WHO hope that incoming President Donald Trump will not upend U. S. alliances or embrace counterterrorism policies that violate civil liberties and human rights have reason to be disturbed by his first national security appointments. The choices of retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser and Rep. Mike Pompeo ( .) as director of the CIA could presage a harsh and counterproductive U. S. approach to the Muslim world, a dangerous turn toward Russia and the reembrace of tactics for handling terrorism suspects that violate international law. Mr. Flynn, a close adviser to Mr.",

        "Before I was a critic, I spent three years reporting on the federal workforce for Government Executive, the outstanding magazine about the business of government. I covered pay raises, the returns from the Thrift Savings Plan and proposals for a system. But I also reported on understaffing in the air traffic control system, visited the National Security Agency to learn about its use of adaptive technologies for employees with disabilities and the coalescing workplace culture of the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "The Zika virus that has spread to more than 50 countries is no longer considered an international public health emergency, the World Health Organization declared Friday. But the change in designation does not represent a downgrading of Zika\u2019s importance, officials said. The WHO labeled Zika an international emergency in February primarily to understand what was causing the \u201dextraordinary clustering\u201d of microcephaly cases in Brazil, the epicenter of the outbreak, said David Heymann, who chairs the expert panel that made the recommendation.",

        "The Obama administration on Friday banned offshore drilling in the Arctic, setting a likely collision course with Donald Trump, who has vowed to \u201cunleash\u201d new energy production in the United States by rolling back restrictions on oil and gas companies. The move by the Interior Department, part of a new plan for energy development in federal waters, would put a temporary end to exploration in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off the Alaskan coast. It also dropped plans to allow companies to drill for oil and natural gas in the Atlantic Ocean off of four southeastern states, including Virginia.",
        "Every year at Thanksgiving, we\u2019re subjected to stories about how to cope with your drunk uncle, your bratty cousin, your grandma with an ax to grind. And every year, at least for those who come from your typical, slightly dysfunctional but lovably kooky family, the idea that we\u2019d need an entire coping strategy to get through one meal seems a bit histrionic. This year is different. Hoooboy, do some of us need advice on how to get along with our families after a year like this one.",
        "As the White House announced its annual turkey pardoning for the day before Thanksgiving, an animal rights group claimed that the Pennsylvania farm that supplies turkeys to the first family keeps its birds in densely crowded, inhumane conditions. The advocacy group, Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) said it filmed animals at Jaindl Turkey Farms in Orefield, Pa. over several months beginning in June. In video and images released by the group, the animals appear to struggle to move and fight one another for space. Some appear sick or injured, and some of the birds have mutilated beaks.",

Brandon Victor Dixon \u2014 the actor who plays Aaron Burr \u2014 stepped forth and cut through the applause. \u201cYou know, we have a guest in the audience this evening,\u201d he said to audience laughter. \u201cAnd Vice Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us just a few more moments.",

        "In the fall of 2015, before Stephen K.

        "Donald Trump met with Mitt Romney, once a fierce critic of the who is now being floated as a potential pick for secretary of state, on Saturday afternoon, setting aside the friction between the two men and signaling a willingness by Trump to entertain different points of view on foreign policy. Romney appeared to warmly shake hands with Trump, each man gripping the arm of the other, as he arrived at Trump\u2019s New Jersey golf course. The two exchanged pleasantries, with Trump placing his hand on Romney\u2019s back, and disappeared behind a large brown door with Vice Mike Pence.",
        "Viewed through any conventional lens, Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy was improbable from start to finish. Today, two things about his victory seem to be in sharper focus: one, that Trump\u2019s victory might best be understood as the success of the country\u2019s first independent president, and second, that the Trump coalition may be even more uniquely his than President Obama\u2019s has turned out to be. Think again about how he prevailed. There are a handful of major events during a general election that give the nominees a chance to showcase themselves, their judgment and their vision.",

        "In the wake of Republican victories on Election Day, some Democrats talk about the way forward for their party. Seth Moulton | Time for new leadership The Democratic Party is in its worst governing position in a generation. Next year we will control just 31 state legislative chambers and 15 governorships. We lost the House of Representatives in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and now the presidency. Clearly the American people are not satisfied with the vision and leadership our party is offering. It s time to make some serious changes to both.",
        "Of all the losers in this season of discontent, the mainstream media top the list. I don\u2019t say this lightly, and I sincerely fear that loss of faith in journalism ultimately will cause more harm to the nation than any outside enemy could hope to. Only 18 percent of Americans trust national news and just 22 percent trust local news, according to the Pew Research Center. That said, of Americans think news organizations keep political leaders in line, though about the same percentage think the news media are biased. Not surprisingly, Republicans more than Democrats think this way.",
        "Less than two weeks into the reality that Donald Trump will be our next president, the situation feels more ominous than on election night. \u201cAt the right time, I will be so presidential you will be so bored,\u201d Trump assured us back in April, when the notion seemed fanciful. \u201cI know when to be presidential. \u201d Does he?

Campuses create \u201csafe spaces\u201d where students can shelter from discombobulating thoughts and receive spiritual balm for the trauma of microaggressions.

        "The heads of the Pentagon and the nation\u2019s intelligence community have recommended to President Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S.

David Sanguesa told ABC affiliate WPLG that he and a colleague met Wednesday for coffee at a Starbucks in Coral Gables, near Miami.",
        "For those who doubt that racial resentment lingers in this nation, Asian Americans are a favorite talking point. The argument goes something like this: If \u201cwhite privilege\u201d is so oppressive \u2014 if the United States is so hostile toward its minorities \u2014 why do census figures show that Asian Americans everyone? In a 2014 editorial, conservative commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly pointed out that Asian household incomes were 20 percent higher than white household incomes on average. \u201cSo, do we have Asian privilege in America?\u201d he asked.
