        "I can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t warn me. On our first date, he told me that she wanted him back. She is his wife; they\u2019ve been separated for almost two years, but she\u2019s still a large presence in his life. And always will be, as she is also the mother of his three young children. I think what he said was: \u201cIf she knew where we were tonight, she\u2019d turn up. \u201d He wasn\u2019t boasting \u2014 it was clearly a warning. \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t put you off me,\u201d he said.",
        "My oldest son\u2019s basketball tryouts are looming this week. He cares deeply about making the team and asked me what he should do to prepare. I suggested he sleep and eat well before the tryouts, which may not have been the novel or answer he was seeking. I gather he was hoping for a magic bullet, something that would make his muscles strong and flexible, deliver him energy, render him well rested, and keep stress at bay. Now that I think of it, buddy, there just may be a magic mineral that does all of these things.",
        "On a recent trip to Colombia, I traveled light with two bags, a banana and no live animals. On the return, I subtracted the fruit and added a third carrier \u2014 and a wiggly dog named Max. To unknowing eyes, I was just a typical traveler with a strong pet attachment. But in truth I was a flight volunteer for Cartagena Paws, an center that, among myriad services, places Colombian street dogs with adoptive families in North America. My ultimate responsibility was to escort the puppy with the overactive tail to the District.",
        "Thanksgiving is all about tradition, so it\u2019s only natural that we field a lot of the same questions each year about the same things. But it\u2019s okay. These things come up again and again for a reason! We\u2019ve gathered some of the most common questions here for your easy perusal.

        "Job seekers, advisers and allies paraded through Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. over the weekend as Donald Trump worked on filling his Cabinet. By Sunday, Marine Gen. James Mattis had emerged as a leading contender for secretary of defense. Members of the Trump team took to the Sunday talk shows. Vice Mike Pence, who heads Trump\u2019s transition, and the incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, defended Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks so far and elaborated on Trump\u2019s more controversial campaign promises, including the reinstatement of waterboarding and a ban on Muslims entering the country.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s pick for chief of staff, Reince Priebus, has vowed that White House counsel will ensure Trump avoids all conflicts of interest with his business ventures during his administration. Last week, Trump held a meeting at Trump Tower with three Indian business partners building a Trump property south of Mumbai. His daughter Ivanka Trump, a vice president at the Trump Organization and one of the family members who will be in charge of Donald Trump\u2019s businesses after he takes office, attended his meeting last week with the Japanese prime minister.",
        "This post has been updated. Donald Trump confirmed Sunday that future first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, will remain in New York after he becomes president, as first reported in the New York Post. When asked about the family\u2019s relocation plans post inauguration Trump, 70, told reporters that he would immediately settle into the executive mansion and that Mrs. Trump and his youngest son, a fourth grader at a Manhattan prep school, would move \u201cVery soon.

Mike Pence. pic. twitter. \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) November 20, 2016 In his first round of Sunday show interviews since the election, Vice Mike Pence did not rule out the possibility that Donald Trump could reinstate waterboarding as an interrogation technique during his administration.

        "When Barack Obama announced his nominee for attorney general eight years ago, he introduced Eric H. Holder Jr. at a news conference with extensive remarks about his qualifications and then handed the podium over to Holder to outline his vision for the Justice Department. When Donald Trump announced his nominee for attorney general on Friday, he introduced Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) to the nation with a quote delivered to the press corps via email.

        "LONG BEACH, Calif. \u2014 Fewer than 2, 000 readers are on his website when Paris Wade, 26, awakens from a nap, reaches for his laptop and thinks he needs to, as he puts it, \u201cfeed\u201d his audience. \u201cMan, no one is covering this TPP thing,\u201d he says after seeing an article suggesting that President Obama wants to pass the Partnership before he leaves office. Wade, a digital opportunist, sees an opportunity. He begins typing a story. \u201cCAN\u2019T TRUST OBAMA,\u201d he writes as the headline, then pauses.",
        "Donald Trump is a creature of New York. He ran against Washington and called it \u201ca swamp. \u201d During his campaign, he often flew home late at night so he could wake up in his own bed. His son is enrolled in a Manhattan private school. So it\u2019s no wonder Trump is reportedly considering spending time in New York whenever he is able \u2014 presumably on weekends. If so, his home, in the penthouse of Trump Tower, on W.",
        "Donald Trump won a narrow victory in the Rust Belt by making a lot of promises he probably can\u2019t keep: that he will bring millions of manufacturing jobs back from Mexico and China; that he will revive coal mining; that he will restore the steel industry in Pittsburgh. But to \u201c America,\u201d as Trump pledged in a speech this summer, he won\u2019t need to do any of that. He can deliver for his base by following a much simpler path.",
        "For the past 40 years, every president has placed his personal investments and assets in a blind trust while in the White House, or has sold everything and held cash equivalents. Donald Trump has made it clear that he does not plan to set up such a trust, which would require that his company be run by an outsider who has had no previous business relationship with Trump, and that there be virtually no communication between the outside trustee and Trump or his family during his administration.",
        "Election Day was a blowout for the cause of legal marijuana. Ballot measures legalizing medical or recreational cannabis use passed for the first time in seven states, with a defeat in Arizona the only setback for activists. But, as the experiences of other states show, the thorniest debates are just starting. How should the trade be regulated? Who will benefit financially? How will the federal government act? These questions and others will roil the states for years to come. The presidential and congressional election results have already put some of these measures in peril.",
        "In the days since the election, there have been many calls for forces to remain resolute in their resistance. \u201cIf the presidency of Donald Trump inspires anything, it should be a fierce spirit of opposition,\u201d Leon Wieseltier wrote last weekend in these pages. \u201cThe proper response is steely resolve to wage the fight of our lives,\u201d Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine. But what can liberals and progressives actually do?",
        "There is dangerous talk these days by those who have the ear of some at the highest levels of government. Earlier this week, Carl Higbie, an outspoken Trump surrogate and of Great America PAC, gave an interview with Megyn Kelly of Fox News. They were discussing the notion of a national Muslim registry, a controversial part of the Trump administration\u2019s national security plans, when Higbie dropped a bombshell: \u201cWe did it during World War II with Japanese, which, you know, call it what you will,\u201d he said.",
        "WHISKEYTOWN, Calif. \u2014 The burn boss scanned the snaking trail of the Swasey Recreation Area through thick black sunglasses. She saw firefighters scurrying on a hill above in a smoky blue haze. They were setting dozens of fires to burn away piles of sticks and shrubs that a lightning strike or cigarette butt could use to grow into a wildfire. Their work was part of a key prescribed burn training that could help them move up in rank. But there was a much deeper meaning for burn boss Erin Banwell and the firefighters in the haze.",
        "LIMA, Peru \u2014 President Obama spent the last day of his final foreign trip attempting to make headway on one of the most painful aspects of his foreign policy portfolio: the civil war in Syria.

        "It is a thoroughly surreal moment. But what a teachable one. For the first time in our collective lives, a person who is going to run this country has gone to war with a Broadway production. Think about this. For whatever reason \u2014 an attempt to deflect attention from other looming scandals, an eternally itchy Twitter finger, a desire to defend a comrade \u2014 a of the most powerful country on Earth is using his pulpit to run down a Pulitzer and musical that is, it\u2019s safe to say, far more beloved than he is.",
        "AMONA, West Bank \u2014 Nachum Schwartz is living his dream in a trailer on a windy hill, raising his children and a flock of sheep, as one of the chosen ones. This is the land of Abraham, he said, the biblical home of the Jews, and nobody is going to kick his family off their mountaintop. \u201cWe belong to this land and this land belongs to us,\u201d said the farmer and herdsman, who was among the first Jewish pioneers to settle this outpost in 1996. Now his dreams may be shoveled aside by Israeli bulldozers.",
        "The sun rose as the overnight shift at my emergency department (ED) came to an end. Mr. P had been with us all evening. He had arrived in an ambulance hours earlier after wandering into a homeless shelter, intoxicated. According to the information the ambulance staff delivered to us with Mr. P, he had been disruptive and argumentative at the shelter. According to Mr. P, the shelter staff members had been unreasonable, and he had just been minding his own business.",
        "Brendan V. Sullivan III and Robert Elwood sat across from each other last week in a federal courtroom, separated by the distance at which they played catch as Little League teammates. Now the two men \u2014 sons of prominent families in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are opponents in a bitter trial. \u201cHe is a thief,\u201d Sullivan said on the witness stand.

        "Donald Trump and the Congress are drawing up plans to take on the government bureaucracy they have long railed against, by eroding job protections and grinding down benefits that federal workers have received for a generation. Hiring freezes, an end to automatic raises, a green light to fire poor performers, a ban on union business on the government\u2019s dime and less generous pensions \u2014 these are the contours of the blueprint emerging under Republican control of Washington in January. These changes were once unthinkable to federal employees, their unions and their supporters in Congress.",
        "Donald Trump intends to launch a broad legislative agenda that includes cutting taxes, rolling back the Affordable Care Act, growing the military and rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure. The question is how congressional Republicans, after eight years of apocalyptic warnings about the growing national debt, will respond to the dire fiscal implications of proposals that would likely send the deficit soaring. Taken together, the Trump agenda stands to drain hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the federal balance sheet. His proposed tax cut alone, according to independent analysts, could cost the Treasury as much as $7.",

        "He\u2019s out there, lurking, his fingers poised on the buttons. At any moment, he may strike. News, inevitably, will follow. As he illustrated with tweets about the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d over the weekend, Donald Trump knows how to change the subject \u2014 and the entire news cycle.

        "Two weeks after the election of Donald Trump, this is how divided America has become: People have moved beyond staring at the vast gulf that divides them and proceeded to arguing over who is to blame for it, what to do about it and even whether it exists at all. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re now divided is being manufactured and spread by the media,\u201d said Trump supporter Loy Brunson, 60, a musician in Provo, Utah.
