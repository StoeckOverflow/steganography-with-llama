        "A letter publicized this week by the German tabloid Bild reveals how Donald Trump\u2019s grandfather Friedrich Trump begged local authorities in southern Germany to revoke an expulsion order for avoiding military service as a teenager. His plea, it seems, proved unsuccessful, and he had to settle for a life across the Atlantic.

        "In the modern era of presidential politics, no candidate has ever won the popular vote by more than Hillary Clinton did this year, yet still managed to lose the electoral college. In that sense, 2016 was a historic split: Donald Trump won the presidency by as much as 74 electoral votes (depending on how Michigan ends up) while losing the nationwide vote to Clinton by 1. 7 million votes and counting. But there\u2019s another divide exposed by the election, which researchers at the Brookings Institution recently discovered as they sifted the election returns.",

Last week, you heard the former chairman of the Republican National Committee declare that Donald Trump \u201cis not a Republican. He\u2019s a pragmatic populist. \u201d We\u2019ll see if Trump governs as hopefully as Steele\u2019s description makes it seem.

How was it possible for the least experienced and most unpopular candidate for president in history to win?"
