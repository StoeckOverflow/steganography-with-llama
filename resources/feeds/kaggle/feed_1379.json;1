        "Laila Siddique was on her way to examine a patient at Penn State\u2019s Hershey Medical Center when her phone began to tremble. The medical student glanced at the screen. It was a text from her father. Nasir Siddique kept in close touch with his two children. He had come to the United States from Pakistan as a young man, enlisted in the Army and slowly risen through the ranks, working at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill before retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 2010.",
        "President Obama granted commutations to another 79 federal drug offenders Tuesday, pushing the number of inmates he has granted clemency to past 1, 000. Obama\u2019s historic number of commutations was announced as administration officials are moving quickly to rule on all the pending clemency applications from inmates before the end of the year. The Trump administration is not expected to keep in place Obama\u2019s initiative to provide relief to drug offenders.",
        "Almost two weeks after the election, North Carolinians still don\u2019t know who their next governor will be. And with each passing day, the situation is growing more \u2014 not less \u2014 convoluted and heated. The Democratic challenger to Gov. Pat McCrory (R) claimed victory on election night with a lead out of 4. 2 million votes cast. As provisional and absentee ballots have been counted, the lead of Roy Cooper (D) currently the state\u2019s attorney general, has grown to at least 6, 600 votes (his campaign says it\u2019s more like 8, 900 votes).",
        "It is hard to compare Donald Trump to anyone else in American politics, especially when it comes to the economy. The plans to combine restrictions on goods imported from abroad, which are usually advocated by liberal politicians, with conventionally Republican policies, such as tax relief for the wealthy and major corporations, along with more federal borrowing. More than any U. S. politician\u2019s platform, Trump\u2019s agenda on the economy resembles those of populist leaders abroad.",
        "Amaiya Zafar and Aliyah Charbonier share a belt. (Courtesy of Sarah O\u2019 ) Amaiya Zafar was about to put on her gloves Sunday at the Sugar Bert Boxing National Championships in Kissimmee, Fla. when officials called off the impending fight. Zafar, a devout Muslim from Oakdale, Minn. wears a hijab under her headgear as well as a shirt and leggings under her shorts and top. Such apparel has been deemed a violation of uniform regulations set by the International Boxing Association for reasons USA Boxing executive director Michael Martino called \u201cclearly a safety issue.",
        "Donald Trump on Wednesday selected two prominent Republican women for positions, adding diversity to an inner circle that was already coming under fire for being composed mostly of white men. In a potentially controversial choice, Trump intends to nominate billionaire philanthropist Betsy DeVos for education secretary, turning to a conservative activist who has forcefully pushed for private school voucher programs. Her nomination is expected to face strong opposition from public school advocates, who oppose her efforts to funnel taxpayer dollars from public to private and religious schools.",
        "South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s journey to the United Nations has struck members of both parties as unlikely: the appointment of a Republican with limited foreign policy experience to a post. But through the prism of a career bursting with political diplomacy and ambition, it is a natural next step. Haley, 44, who Donald Trump announced Wednesday as his nominee for U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, has long shuttled between her party\u2019s mainstream and its conservative base, maintaining ties to each wing even as she resists being labeled as \u201ctea party\u201d or \u201cestablishment.",
        "Betsy DeVos is hardly a household name, but the Michigan billionaire and conservative activist has quietly helped change the education landscape in many states, spending millions of dollars in a successful push to expand voucher programs that give families taxpayer dollars to pay for private and religious schools. Now DeVos is poised to spread her preference for vouchers nationwide.",
        "On the campaign trail he complained that they had been \u201creduced to rubble. \u201d At other moments he suggested that he might have to fire them all. Now that Donald Trump is a parade of retired generals has been making its way through Trump Tower and the mogul\u2019s New Jersey golf course. Trump\u2019s sudden infatuation with the military\u2019s top brass is part theater, part necessity and possibly a view into how he will govern.",
        "Donald Trump has received two classified intelligence briefings since his surprise election victory earlier this month, a frequency that is notably lower \u2014 at least so far \u2014 than that of his predecessors, current and former U. S. officials said. A team of intelligence analysts has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won. Vice Mike Pence, by contrast, has set aside time for intelligence briefings almost every day since the election, officials said.",
        "Perhaps we should be thankful this week for Donald Trump\u2019s insincerity. In a breathtaking fortnight of he has reversed many of his most reckless and damaging campaign positions. The new Trump professes sympathy for people and ideas he disdained during the \u201cvicious\u201d campaign. He now admires President Obama, doesn\u2019t want to harm (let alone lock up) Hillary Clinton, is waffling on climate change, and thinks waterboarding might not work. Maybe he\u2019ll even decide that the Partnership is a great trade deal. I hope so. In advertising, this approach is known as \u201cbait and switch.",
        "To Donald Trump, Breitbart News \u2014 the racist, sexist and offensive website once overseen by his campaign chairman and designated White House chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 is \u201cjust a publication. \u201d Breitbart\u2019s editors and writers, Trump told the New York Times, \u201ccover stories like you cover stories. \u201d Granted, Trump said, \u201cthey are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than the New York Times.",
        "how can you speak to your family at thanksgiving? how can you speak to anyone ever again?",
        "While we\u2019re still analyzing the election results and debating the importance of different factors to the final outcome, everyone agrees that white working class voters played a key part in Donald Trump\u2019s victory, in some cases by switching their votes and in some cases by turning out when they had been nonvoters before. And now that he\u2019s about to take office, he\u2019s ready to deliver on what he promised them, right?",
        "Debbie Berkowitz is a senior fellow at the National Employment Law Project. She formerly served as chief of staff at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As you pick up your Thanksgiving turkey this year, you may look to see whether it\u2019s organic, and humanely raised and slaughtered. What the label won\u2019t tell you is how the men and women in the poultry plant who processed your bird are treated. You may not want to know \u2014 but you should. Poultry production is big business. Poultry is the United States\u2019 most popular meat, and profits are soaring.",
        "As Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 states that once were the stronghold of the nation\u2019s industrial union movement \u2014 dropped into Donald Trump\u2019s column on election night, one longtime union staff member told me that Trump\u2019s victory was \u201can event for American labor. \u201d He may be right. A ago, more than a third of those Rust Belt workers were unionized, and their unions had the clout to win them a decent wage, benefits and pensions. Their unions also had the power to turn out the vote. They did \u2014 for Democrats.",
        "LASIK isn\u2019t always as awesome as we might think. Millions of Americans each year undergo LASIK surgery to correct their vision. Given how common the procedure has become and how ubiquitous the ads are on radio and TV, you might be tempted to treat the decision to get the treatment pretty casually or think of it as purely a financial decision. A team of researchers from the Food and Drug Administration, the National Eye Institute and the Department of Defense would like to make sure you weigh the potential risks to your eyes more seriously.",
        "LONDON \u2014 A man whose bookshelf was full of writings on white supremacy and Nazism was found guilty Wednesday of killing British lawmaker Jo Cox in an apparent political attack as the country headed toward its landmark vote on European Union membership. The shooting and stabbing in June stunned Britain and underscored the divisions over the E. U. referendum, which tipped in favor of groups \u2014 including and nationalist factions \u2014 seeking to leave the bloc.",
        "Could it be a grim and grinchy December for thousands of homeowners facing ongoing challenges with their mortgage payments and property values? Could popular deductions for mortgage insurance premiums and home improvements abruptly vanish? That\u2019s the way things are shaping up in the closing weeks of the lame duck congressional session. Republicans controlling the committees in the House and Senate say they have no plans to extend expiring provisions such as forgiveness for financially troubled owners, used by buyers and deductions for purchases of windows, insulation and other improvements. All three benefits terminate Dec. 31.",
        "As she prepares to fly to North Carolina for Thanksgiving, Dale Koontz said she knows she will be in the minority. Koontz, 23, a staff assistant at a firm in Washington, voted for Hillary Clinton. Everyone at the holiday table will likely be Donald Trump supporters or at least Hillary opponents, she figures. Although she\u2019s close to her mother, who supported Trump, it took five days after the election for them to talk on the phone, she said. \u201cWe kind of avoided talking about it for the first half of the conversation,\u201d she said.",
        "Lately, your brain has probably been a fog of factoids about the electoral college, exit polls and cabinet appointments. And so it may not have sunken in yet that the holiday season is practically upon us. But, alas, here we are, just hours from the annual smorgasbord of Black Friday deals that lure many of us to get in the spirit. Here, we\u2019ve rounded up some information to help you decide when and where to open your wallet. When do the sales start?",
        "The No. 1 rule for holiday shopping should be to stay out of debt. So before you hit the stores, make your list and check it twice. And don\u2019t feel bad about crossing some people off your list if your budget is tight, consumer experts say. \u201cMy big thing is you should not be going into debt to spread some holiday cheer,\u201d says Jodi RR Smith, owner of Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting, which coaches businesses and individuals on communication.",
        "An Indiana man accused of not paying more than $1, 000 in state income taxes says he can\u2019t be found guilty of tax evasion because he is protected by Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Rodney who argues that paying his state taxes imposes a burden on his religious beliefs, is the latest to use the Indiana law to justify an alleged crime. Earlier this year, an Indianapolis mother accused of beating her son used the law unsuccessfully to justify punishing a child. Signed into law last year by Gov.",
        "Kazakhstan\u2019s parliament has unanimously voted to rename its capital, Astana, for autocratic President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has led the country since 1989. It remains unclear whether Nazarbayev will approve the decision \u2014 he refused a similar proposal in 2008 \u2014 though the Reuters news agency notes that over the past few years the leader has appeared more amenable to moves designed to honor him. Several monuments to him have recently been installed, and Kazakhstan\u2019s central bank said last week that a portrait of Nazarbayev would appear on a bank note for the first time on Dec.",
        "NASA scientists have been daydreaming about a new kind of engine that could carry astronauts to Mars in 70 days without burning any fuel. Now, in a new paper published in the Journal of Propulsion and Power, they say that it might really work. The paper, written by astrophysicists at NASA\u2019s Eagleworks Laboratories, tested a electromagnetic propulsion system, or \u201cEM drive,\u201d that generates a small amount of thrust simply by bouncing microwaves around a copper chamber. No propellant goes in, no exhaust comes out, and yet, somehow, the engine can make things move.",
        "If not for one unforgettable fastball, hurled Oct. 3, 1951, pitcher Ralph Branca of the Brooklyn Dodgers might have faded from baseball memory. In a dozen major league seasons, he won 88 games and lost 68, a workmanlike record, a ticket to obscurity. But for an autumn afternoon long ago. Facing the New York Giants with a lead and the National League championship at stake, he threw a high fastball in the ninth inning to the Giants\u2019 Bobby Thomson, a dangerous hitter.",
        "The Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize showcases portraiture across different photographic processes, styles and genres, and celebrates a range of experience from professional to amateur. Photographs included in this year\u2019s exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, London, were chosen from 4, 303 submissions entered by 1, 842 photographers from 61 countries. They could stand alone or be a part of a series. The motivations for the photographs vary widely, from explorations of societal questions to inquiry into personal history.",
        "Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor considered the \u201cking of bankruptcy\u201d for buying companies with the potential to deliver profits, is expected to be Donald Trump\u2019s choice for commerce secretary, two officials with knowledge of the decision said. Ross helped shape the Trump campaign\u2019s economic agenda, particularly its stance on the need to renegotiate \u2014 or even withdraw from \u2014 free trade agreements. That position resonated with the working class voters who were instrumental in delivering Trump\u2019s upset victory.",
        "PARIS \u201d When Donald Trump shocked the world with an upset victory in the U. S. presidential election this month, much of Europe was aghast. But in at least one critical sense, the result couldn t have been more European: Across the continent, parties of the that have dominated politics for decades \u201d and that have given Europe its reputation for generous social welfare systems \u201d now find themselves beaten, divided and directionless. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are just the latest members of a beleaguered club.",
        "At the this fall, members of Washington\u2019s diplomatic community gathered inside the historic hotel\u2019s loft, with its postcard views of the White House, for a conversation about fashion. About clothes and their place on the world stage. The program, hosted by the State Department and Elle magazine, included a panel discussion, in which I was invited to participate, that featured designer Derek Lam. When the conversation came around to first lady Michelle Obama \u2014 because how could it not?"
