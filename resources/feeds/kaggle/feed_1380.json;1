        "In my politically diverse extended family, Thanksgiving was always a happy version of \u201cCrossfire\u201d or \u201cFiring Line,\u201d the occasion for raucous debates over the future of our country. My childhood and early teen years coincided with the 1960s, so the discussions sometimes got bitter. Bitter, but never devoid of love and affection. Usually, we had Thanksgiving at the home of my godparents, Aunt Do and Uncle Emile. My aunt tried briefly to ban political conflagrations but gave up, realizing that the combatants enjoyed them.",
        "Democrats from President Obama on down are blaming their 2016 debacle in part on too much \u201cidentity politics\u201d \u2014 messaging aimed not at voters broadly, but at Latinos, women, African Americans and the LGBT community as groups. The one group Democrats did not target were their old mainstays, whites (especially the males of that species) who responded by giving Donald Trump a margin of 39 points over Hillary Clinton, while voters of color failed to vote for her in the expected numbers.",
        "At this shank end of a shabby year, Americans still can be thankful: They do not have the problem of nothing to grumble about. As we steel ourselves for Thanksgiving\u2019s obligatory routs and revels \u2014 does anyone really like turkey? or Uncle Ralph, who keeps turning up, like a bad penny? \u2014 Americans are cudgeling their brains for reasons to feel gratitude. So, herewith, a call for everyone to temper gloom with lucidity. Things could be worse. And they often have been while Americans nevertheless have given thanks.",
        "THANKSGIVING AS we know it was first celebrated 153 years ago, when the nation was divided by a savage civil war. Abraham Lincoln proclaimed the new national holiday to help foster a sense of unity in a country torn between its regions and within them. But he also had a greater idea in mind, which had been stated just a week before Thanksgiving, in his speech at Gettysburg honoring the thousands who had died there some months before.",
        "A U. S. service member was killed by an improvised explosive device in northern Syria on Thursday, the Pentagon announced in a statement. The service member was killed near Ayn Issa, a town roughly 35 miles northwest of the Islamic State\u2019s capital of Raqqa. The death marks the first time a U. S. service member has been killed in the country since a contingent of Special Operations forces were deployed there in October 2015 to go after the extremist group. \u201cThe entire [Islamic State] coalition sends its condolences to this hero\u2019s, family, friends and teammates,\u201d said Lt.",
        "Caption   Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from the city because of the fires, which began Monday and may have been set intentionally.   Nov. 24, 2016 A raging wildfire ripped through parts of Haifa, Israel\u2019s   city, prompting a rare   of hundreds of military reservists to join overstretched police and firefighters. Ariel",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 A Russian human rights group has published a database containing personal information about nearly 40, 000 members of the notorious security force that carried out Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin\u2019s purges, shedding light on an ugly stretch of history the Kremlin would prefer to remain hidden. The archive, culled from the records of Stalin\u2019s security forces (the NKVD) and posted on the website of Memorial, the human rights group, for the first time names those who carried out some 700, 000 executions from 1935 to 1939 during \u201cThe Great Terror.",
        "It\u2019s one of America\u2019s most enduring mysteries \u2014 the only unsolved hijacking of a commercial airliner in the country\u2019s history: Who was the man known as \u201cD. B. Cooper\u201d who took control of a Northwest Orient jet shortly before Thanksgiving in 1971 and parachuted out with $200, 000? On Thanksgiving Day, a website founded by the author of the most authoritative book on Cooper is releasing hundreds of FBI investigative documents related to the case.",
        "With the 49ers visiting the Dolphins this week, San Francisco\u2019s Colin Kaepernick engaged in a conference call with members of the South Florida media. However, one reporter wanted to discuss something that happened in August, when Kaepernick wore a shirt that appeared to show support for Fidel Castro, which led to a tense exchange. The shirt depicted scenes from a 1960 meeting between Castro and Malcolm X, and it bore the phrase, \u201cLike minds think alike.",
        "The Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade kicked off a day of annual traditions, but if you\u2019re a dog lover, the real show began at noon. We\u2019re talking about the National Dog Show. Gia won Best in Show out of six other finalists including Ty, a giant schnauzer; Slick, a border collie; Timmy, an English springer spaniel; Chuck, a Pekingese; Rondo, a West Highland white terrier; and Clue, a Tibetan terrier (who, fun fact, is not actually a terrier). The seven finalists competed among a lineup of 2, 000 dogs spanning more than 200 breeds and varieties.",
        "From the beginning, Jim Ford said, he was reluctant about repossessing Pat and Stanford Kipping\u2019s car. Even though that was, obviously, the job. Ford is a repo man, of Illini Recovery Inc. a company in Southern Illinois. And earlier this month, he was working a job involving the Kippings\u2019 vehicle, a 1998 Buick, the Belleville reported. Instead of repo\u2019ing the Buick, though, Ford decided to do something a little different. He found a way to pay off the car \u2014 and return it to the couple.",
        "Inez Harries and Venice Shaw, born 1911 Identical twins Inez Harries and Venice Shaw were so similar growing up that sometimes their parents couldn\u2019t tell them apart. Harries passed shortly after their 103rd birthday, with Venice at her side. \u201cBe honest, give lots of love, and keep a close family,\u201d Harries said. When Paul Mobley embarked on a journey to photograph centenarians across the United States, his dad suggested that he ask everyone what the secret to longevity is. When he did, he got a plethora of heartfelt answers, like \u201cbasic human kindness.",
        "Days after Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, a news agency in the former Soviet republic of Georgia reported that a plan for a tower in a seaside Georgian resort town was now back on track. Likewise, the local developer of a Trump Tower planned for Buenos Aires announced last week, three days after Trump spoke with Argentina\u2019s president, that the project was moving ahead. Meanwhile, foreign government leaders seeking to speak with Trump have reached out to the through his overseas network of business partners, an unusually informal process for calls traditionally coordinated with the U. S. State Department.",
        "An election recount will take place soon in Wisconsin, after former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein filed a petition Friday with the state\u2019s Election Commission, the first of three states where she has promised to contest the election result. The move from Stein, who raised millions since her Wednesday announcement that she would seek recounts of Donald Trump\u2019s apparent election victories in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, came just 90 minutes before Wisconsin\u2019s 5 p. m. Friday deadline to file a petition.",
        "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 On a day here, tourist Kinsey Hoffman saw many things she\u2019d never seen before: mansions with eagle statues decorating the driveway; lined up 10 abreast bobbing in the Intracoastal Waterway; chic boutiques on Worth Avenue, where a dog collar costs $475. But as impressive as all that was, Hoffman was really dazzled by what she saw crossing the bridge to get to the island. \u201cSeeing boats with Secret Service people and machine guns, that\u2019s kind of not what you expect when you\u2019re going to the beach.",
        "In the Dakota language, the word \u201coahe\u201d signifies \u201ca place to stand on. \u201d And that\u2019s what the Standing Rock Sioux and its allies in the environmental and activist movements say they are doing: using Lake Oahe in North Dakota as a place to take a stand by setting up camps and obstructing roads to block the controversial $3. 7 billion Dakota Access pipeline. Their confrontations with police \u2014 who have responded with water cannons, pepper spray and rubber bullets \u2014 have steered attention to the oil pipeline project and its owner, Energy Transfer Partners.",
        "Lisette Candia Diaz lives in New York. My future has always been blurry. It\u2019s an inherent characteristic of the undocumented experience. But when I got into Harvard University, everyone told me that my life was about to change: Your future is set. This was it. We finally made it. The American dream was within my grasp. Years later, my mom told me that on the night that I was accepted, my dad cried. Late at night, he turned to her and said, \u201cEsto significa que yo hice algo bien. \u201d This means I did something right.",
        "In this season of Thanksgiving, a quirky source of gratitude has emerged \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s many campaign lies. What else can one call the promises that he now treats as alien concepts? Almost daily, he reverses himself on a campaign promise, confirming what this column predicted: He would never keep his vows. As a matter of practicality, Trump couldn\u2019t do much of what he bragged about, such as build the wall and make Mexico pay for it. Now he\u2019s talking fences.",
        "Eric Chenoweth is of the Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe. In assessing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, Americans continue to look away from this election\u2019s most alarming story: the successful effort by a hostile foreign power to manipulate public opinion before the vote. U. S. intelligence agencies determined that the Russian government actively interfered in our elections. Russian state propaganda gave little doubt that this was done to support Trump, who repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin and excused the Russian president\u2019s foreign aggression and domestic repression. Most significantly, U. S.",
        "History has a sly sense of humor. It caused an epiphany regarding infrastructure projects \u2014 roads, harbors, airports, etc. \u2014 to occur on a bridge over Boston\u2019s Charles River, hard by Harvard Yard, where rarely is heard a discouraging word about government. Last spring, Larry Summers, former treasury secretary and Harvard president, was mired in congealed traffic on the bridge, which is being repaired, and he suddenly understood \u201cAmerican sclerosis. \u201d Repairing the bridge, which was built in 11 months in 1912, will take about five years.",
        "Mehdi Hasan is a British broadcaster and author based in Washington. He is the host of \u201cUpFront\u201d on Al Jazeera English. Consider the following scenarios: What if Venezuela held a presidential election and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory with fewer votes than his main rival? Or if Russian liberals won the most votes in the country\u2019s legislative elections but failed to secure the most seats in the Duma? Or if Iranian authorities tried to prevent members of the country\u2019s largest minority group from voting? Can you imagine the howls of outrage from the White House press secretary?",
        "SOME OF the people can be fooled all of the time, and some seem plenty pleased about it when it gives them license to exercise their most malicious impulses. How else to explain the noxious torrent of vitriol, venom and threats trained recently against a popular upper Northwest Washington pizzeria, which has been the subject of ludicrous conspiracy theories alleging that it is the center of a child abuse racket run by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta?",
        "The Obama administration is giving the elite Joint Special Operations Command \u2014 the organization that helped kill Osama bin Laden in a 2011 raid by Navy SEALs \u2014 expanded power to track, plan and potentially launch attacks on terrorist cells around the globe, a move driven by concerns of a dispersed terrorist threat as Islamic State militants are driven from strongholds in Iraq and Syria, U. S. officials said. The missions could occur well beyond the battlefields of places like Iraq, Syria and Libya where Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) has carried out clandestine operations in the past.",
        "A federal judge on Friday ruled that Dylann Roof, the accused of killing nine parishioners in a Charleston, S. C. church last year, is competent to stand trial. Jury selection will resume in the case on Monday with individual questioning of prospective jurors, the judge said. U. S. District Judge Richard Gergel made the ruling in a order that kept sealed exactly what he found, a step he said was necessary to make sure Roof gets a fair trial. Hearings on the matter were also conducted in secret.",
        "This holiday shopping season, retailers are eagerly promoting their programs, in which shoppers can place an order online and pick it up at a nearby store. The big chains are salivating over the possibility this model lets them fulfill your orders faster \u2014 in a matter of hours, not days \u2014 and it allows them to utilize their outposts in the fight for your spending. But last year during the seasonal rush, many shoppers found that these pickup programs were a mess.",
        "Small Business Saturday is this Saturday. It\u2019s become a really, really big thing. How big? The campaign began back in 2009 by American Express when the country, and small businesses in particular, was still recovering from the Great Recession. The plan was to offer incentives to get people shopping again (and of course use their AmEx cards) at local merchants. And then things exploded. By 2015, the event attracted 95 million shoppers who spent more than $16 billion, according to this blog entry from the business telephone provider Grasshopper. com.",
        "Sherri Papini. (Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office) A Northern California woman who was apparently abducted earlier this month during a jog was found Thanksgiving Day, when she was released by her captor on a rural road in Yolo County, authorities said. Police said Sherri Papini, 34, who was bound in restraints, flagged down a passing motorist, who immediately alerted law enforcement. \u201cWe are ecstatic to report that Sherri Papini has been located and has been reunited with her family on this day of Thanksgiving,\u201d Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko told reporters Thursday during a news conference.",
        "So, did you love them? Hate them? Or did you predict them from the beginning? We speak, obviously, of the final four words of \u201cGilmore Girls. \u201d The backstory: In 2006, creator Amy gave an interview to TV Guide where she confirmed that she already knew the last four words of the show. Of course, that was right after she exited the series before its seventh and last season, so fans assumed they would never get to hear them.",
        "Whatever you think you know about college costs, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s going to cost more. Lots more. For many families, college\u2019s hidden costs will probably be a prime topic of discussion this Thanksgiving weekend, when students filter home \u2014 many for the first time since school started \u2014 for urgently needed refills on grub, family face time and cold cash. Take it from me \u2014 the father of a college freshman. We thought we knew what our daughter\u2019s first year at school would cost, but we were dead wrong. You, however, don\u2019t have to be.",
        "ARLINGTON, Tex. \u2014 The Washington Redskins don\u2019t yet have the hard punch, the blow that floors an opponent. They have finesse and big plays and yards, lots and lots of yards. They\u2019re pretty and efficient, with all kinds of nifty numbers. But what they lack is a fist. The lack explains so many of their baffling and decisions that leave their fans bleating, \u201cWhy?\u201d Why try a field goal into the blinding Texas sun with a kicker who is struggling? Why onside kick when you\u2019ve just closed to within single digits of the Dallas Cowboys?"
