        "HAVANA \u2014 For the nearly five decades Fidel Castro ruled this country, he was a daily presence in Cubans\u2019 lives. His speeches echoed on their televisions, and his stern rules shaped almost every aspect of their existence. They woke up Saturday and found out he was gone. A numbness has set in here since. Few Cubans seemed to believe the death of Castro at age 90 will bring immediate transformation of their country, the only state in the Western Hemisphere. After all, poor health forced Castro aside in 2006, and the system he created has carried on without him.",
        "For more than half a century, Cuba played an outsize role in America\u2019s political psyche. Even when his country ceased to be much of a policy concern \u2014 long after the memories of threatened nuclear attack and Third World adventurism had faded \u2014 Fidel Castro remained the nettlesome, living symbol of how a small island had thumbed its nose at the United States and survived.",
        "MIAMI \u2014 Chanting \u201cFree Cuba! Down with tyranny!\u201d hundreds of people took to the streets of Little Havana on Saturday to celebrate the death of a man whose brutal dictatorship drove them or their parents from their native Cuba. Fidel Castro was old and in failing health, but he was also a tyrant who prohibited free speech, jailed or killed political opponents and even abolished Christmas as a national holiday. So when his death was announced late Friday, those who fled Cuba for a better life in the United States saw cause for jubilation.",

        "Hours after Fidel Castro\u2019s death was announced, President Barack Obama didn\u2019t just offer his condolences to the family of the former Cuban leader. He also extended \u201da hand of friendship\u201d to the Cuban people \u2014 a reminder of his administration\u2019s efforts to renew diplomatic ties with the country\u2019s close Caribbean neighbor, but a far cry from Castro\u2019s policies of isolation and independence.",
        "In America, Donald Trump and Cuban American senators all but cheered Fidel Castro\u2019s death. A little farther north, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was mourning \u201ca larger than life leader who served his people for almost half a century. \u201d \u201cWhile a controversial figure, both Mr. Castro\u2019s supporters and detractors recognized his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a deep and lasting affection for \u2018el Comandante,\u2019 \u201d Trudeau\u2019s statement said.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 On every stage where a Latin American leader launched into soaring oratory against the imperialists, Fidel Castro was present. In every lonely jungle hideout where guerrillas in plotted their fight, Castro kept them company. In every country where revolutionaries and communists dreamed of creating a workers\u2019 paradise, Castro was a guiding light. No single figure did more to define generations of Latin Americans who sought political upheaval than Castro. His rants inspired followers in countries that also saw resources sucked away by local elites in cahoots with the mighty United States.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign has been quietly exploring whether there was any \u201coutside interference\u201d in the election results and will participate in the election recount in Wisconsin initiated by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, a Clinton campaign lawyer revealed Saturday.",
        "On Wednesday, she woke up inconsolable. On Thursday, angry. But on the Friday after the presidential election, as she prepared posters to join thousands in protesting Donald Trump\u2019s victory, Mia Hern\u00e1ndez came to a quiet realization: If she found her country\u2019s direction intolerable, she would have to try to change it. She would change it not just by signing petitions, or protesting, or calling her legislators. For the first time, she sketched out a plan to run for elected office.",
        "Of all the promises made on the campaign trail, Donald Trump\u2019s vow to pass a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress might be the most daunting. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) dismissed the idea out of hand the day after Trump\u2019s stunning victory. A few days later, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) gave the proposal a tepid endorsement as he indicated it would be up to a House committee to consider Trump\u2019s proposal. The reticence of both Republican leaders on the issue is not surprising, given their long tenures in Congress.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil has been bogged down in a recession for more than two years but one business is still growing. Fast food. And as it expands, so does the country\u2019s obesity problem. Brazil\u2019s government won worldwide plaudits for bringing 36 million people out of poverty during 13 years of rule by the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, which ended in August. As the economy boomed and consumer spending followed, some people even joined a class which by 2014 had swelled to almost 60 percent of the population.",
        "IN CONTRAST to his long life of violence, both verbal and physical, Fidel Castro\u2019s demise at 90 was, apparently, peaceful. Cuba\u2019s communist dictator from 1959 until illness obliged him to hand control to his brother Ra\u00fal in 2006, Mr. Castro did not so much die as fade away. It was an unlikely conclusion to a turbulent career that Mr. Castro\u2019s many enemies, including successive U. S. administrations, might gladly have ended more abruptly many years ago. Mr.",
        "At 12:33 a. m. my phone sings a tritone text message alert. \u201cFidel dead,\u201d the first one reads, a minimalist headline. I flip on the TV. It\u2019s all so predictable: the calls to Miami journalists, camera shots of a celebratory march on Calle Ocho, montaged flashbacks of the revolutionary\u2019s speeches. As usual, news on Cuba is focused on the past. But many on the island are wondering what happens next. Their future economic progress that feels more fickle now that Donald Trump is the U. S. .",
        "Once when I was serving in the federal government, in the early 2000s, the Treasury Department was ready to issue an obscure communique. Just before it was set to be released, someone noticed a stray punctuation mark. The picayune typo could have led some to interpret the communique as a U. S. policy reversal on some territory where sovereignty was disputed. This mattered: Historically, foreign officials and the press parse every word that presidents and policy principals say to decipher any changes in policy. Even minute shifts in language can send important signals to the world.",
        "Kristen Soltis Anderson and Patrick Ruffini are of the Republican research firm Echelon Insights. Planes rarely crash because one instrument fails or one gauge gives a bad reading. Rather, the right combination of things fail in tandem \u2014 a mechanical problem paired with bad weather, a backup system malfunctioning at the same time as a pilot error \u2014 leading to catastrophe. The disaster of the 2016 election forecasts is not dissimilar, with a series of mistakes building upon one another to lead prognosticators astray.",
        "The phrase \u201c \u201d was conceived as a catchall for various unsavory subcommunities of the conservative right by Richard Spencer. The white nationalist founded Alternative Right. com in 2010 and now serves as president of the National Policy Institute, a think tank that cloaks extremist ideas in airy, academic language. For several years, the movement festered on the periphery of mainstream political discourse on message boards such as 4chan and 8chan, where its acerbic spirit and menacingly goofy aesthetic developed, partially through memes.",
        "Learning about the body\u2019s many excretions, secretions and suppurations in medical school, I realized that each medical specialty has its own essential effluent. And I heard that some physicians choose their careers based on the bodily fluid they find least revolting. Thus, a doctor disgusted by stool and pus but able to stand the sight of blood might end up a hematologist, while one repulsed by urine and bile but tolerant of sputum might choose pulmonology. Many physicians are actively drawn to a particular bodily fluid, intrigued by its unique diagnostic mysteries.",
        "On July 17, 1983, a small Indian newspaper called the Patriot published a article titled \u201cAIDS may invade India: Mystery disease caused by US experiments. \u201d The story cited a letter from an anonymous but \u201c American scientist and anthropologist\u201d that suggested AIDS, then still a mysterious and deadly new disease, had been created by the Pentagon in a bid to develop new biological weapons. \u201cNow that these menacing experiments seem to have gone out of control, plans are being hatched to hastily transfer them from the U.

        "IRBIL, Iraq \u2014 The Iraqi parliament passed a law Saturday making militia units, including groups accused of human rights abuses, an official part of the country\u2019s security forces. Lawmakers passed the measure 208 to 0 in a session that was boycotted by most Sunni politicians, who opposed an initiative that extends the influence of powerful Shiite groups that many Iraqi Sunnis view with suspicion. Prime Minister Haider praised the law, saying that it gave due to fighters who had proved themselves a key part of Iraqi defenses since the onslaught by Islamic State militants in 2014.",
        "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 When the four hours and merciless tension had ended and the moods of two substantial rivals had parted into wild divergence, the participants in Ohio State\u2019s win over Michigan on Saturday began the steep task of processing. \u201cI guess I just looked around like, \u2018Man, that just happened,\u2019 \u201d Ohio State quarterback J.

Further north, beyond the massive Yukon River valley, was Deadhorse, an oil town at the mouth of Prudhoe Bay.",
        "A thousand years ago, before Michael Greenspan and I got married, we made a prenuptial agreement: I would do the cooking (never mind that I had never cooked before) and he would do the dishes. It\u2019s a great arrangement every day except Thanksgiving, when the forces of Michael\u2019s tidiness and his lifelong disaffection with turkey collide, and he gives away every leftover morsel of the bird and its stuffing. He leaves the potatoes, because he likes them, and the cranberry sauce, because it\u2019s what I like.",
        "Donald Trump spent Sunday ridiculing Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign for joining a recount effort in Wisconsin, ending his day on Twitter by parroting a widely debunked conspiracy theory that her campaign benefited from massive voter fraud. As his senior advisers engaged in an escalating feud over who the next secretary of state should be, Trump focused publicly on Clinton\u2019s tally of 64 million votes \u2014 more than 2 million beyond what he garnered \u2014 by suggesting without evidence that millions of people illegally voted in the election.",

        "Something has clearly been gnawing at Donald Trump. Sure, he won the electoral vote and therefore the presidency, but he lost the popular vote by 2. 2 million votes \u2014 and counting. (Counting mostly in California, where Democrat Hillary Clinton won easily and where there are 1. 4 million more ballots to tally.) Trump\u2019s victory is marred by that fact: He will be the president, but more people voted against him.",
        "By Election Day, ambitious Democrats had already resigned themselves to an wait for their chance in the national spotlight. Hillary Clinton was an overwhelming favorite against Donald Trump and, assuming she won, running a primary challenge against her in four years would be a fool\u2019s errand. Then Clinton lost. Although this most stunning upset in modern presidential history has produced (and will produce) a thousand aftershocks, one of the most unlikely and important is that the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 is now open.",

Despite search efforts, neither ship was found."
