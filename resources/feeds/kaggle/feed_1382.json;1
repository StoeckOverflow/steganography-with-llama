        "HAVANA \u2014 Fidel Castro once called George W. Bush a \u201cfunctional illiterate. \u201d President Ronald Reagan was \u201cthe worst terrorist in the history of mankind,\u201d Castro said, with ideas \u201cfrom the Buffalo Bill era. \u201d Castro thrived on confrontation with U. S. leaders, and he almost surely would have enjoyed facing off against America\u2019s next one. In his statement Saturday on Castro\u2019s death, Donald Trump denounced him as \u201ca brutal dictator,\u201d and that\u2019s the sort of dig that wouldn\u2019t have gone unanswered in the past.",

        "BEIRUT \u201d Thousands of Syrian civilians fled fierce fighting in Aleppo on Sunday as government forces moved within a mile of slicing the city s last stronghold in half. At least 500 people have been killed and more than 1, 000 wounded in a offensive led by President Bashar s troops on the east side of a city that has taken on huge symbolic importance in the Syrian civil war. Under siege and with no food aid left, half a million civilians are now trapped there. On Sunday, residents said they had nowhere left to run.",

But Alexander Heffner is, in a modest way, trying to do battle with our fractious world, as seen on TV. The \u2019s weapon of choice is a weekly television show called \u201cThe Open Mind. \u201d Everything about it seems countercultural, even radical, given this disagreeable and moment in American history. conversations with very little emphasis on politics?",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s decision last week to nominate Betsy DeVos, a Michigan billionaire and conservative activist, as his education secretary has caused great consternation in parts of the education world \u2014 those parts that are deeply concerned about the future of public education.",
        "LONDON \u2014 What shaped European politics over the past two years might appear to some like a revolution of rural Europe rising up against the establishment and economic winners. Support for Britain leaving the European Union was highest in rural areas in the June referendum. It is also \u201crural France\u201d that might empower politician Marine Le Pen next year. In Germany, the urban establishment underestimated the backlash the recent influx of refugees would provoke in less densely populated areas. In northern Europe\u2019s biggest countries, the divide appears to have shaped Europe in 2016.",

S. cents on the black market. The currency has dropped dramatically in value as Venezuela\u2019s economy has cratered and the government has frantically printed more money. Prices, meanwhile, are soaring.",

David Petraeus, a possible alternative choice for secretary of state amid an escalating feud over the position between supporters of former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who will sit down with Trump on Tuesday.

        "Donald Trump and Green Party candidate Jill Stein continued raising competing doubts about the election on Monday, with Trump\u2019s transition team voicing concerns about voter fraud without providing evidence and Stein taking legal action to trigger a recount in Pennsylvania, one of three states she has targeted for additional scrutiny. Trump on Monday was also officially declared the winner in Michigan by a slim margin. Stein announced plans to force a recount there on Wednesday. In Wisconsin, where Stein asked for a recount last week, elections officials on Monday announced a timeline and procedure for it.",

University public safety officials identified the student as Abdul Razak Ali Artan, who neighbors said belonged to a large Somali family living in Columbus. Authorities said they did not yet know what motivated the attack but could not rule out the possibility of terrorism.",
        "For a man given to fiery rhetoric and sermons, Abu Muhammad became oddly quiet during his last summer as the chief spokesman for the Islamic State. The Syrian who exhorted thousands of young Muslims to don suicide belts appeared increasingly obsessed with his own safety, U. S. officials say. He banished cellphones, shunned large meetings and avoided going outdoors in the daytime. He began sleeping in crowded tenements in a northern Syrian town called betting on the presence of young children to shield him from the drones prowling the skies overhead.",

        "Donald Trump is either a mad genius who has cracked the media code in a way no politician before him was able to do, or he\u2019s a kind of political Mr. Magoo, stumbling randomly about yet achieving one success after another. We may never know which it is. But if we\u2019re going to maintain our democracy, we have to figure out how to deal with the way Trump successfully manipulates the media.",
        "We are in that period after the general election when Donald Trump and his team enjoy a honeymoon. Stories recounting the campaign\u2019s electoral genius abound. Profiles of his Cabinet picks and staff are so glowing that you need sunglasses to read them. It\u2019s a custom I respect. The incoming administration should be given a chance, especially to prove us wrong. But the whitewashing of Steve Bannon is unacceptable. The incoming chief White House strategist and senior counselor to the president turned the conservative Breitbart. com into a repository of breathtaking racist, xenophobic and garbage.",

On the right these days, we find it in the conviction that uttering the magic words \u201cradical Islam\u201d is critical to the fight against terrorism.

        "What is it like to stare into the face of evil? James E. Mitchell knows. In his gripping new memoir, \u201cEnhanced Interrogation: Inside the Minds and Motives of the Islamic Terrorists Trying To Destroy America,\u201d Mitchell describes the day he was questioning Khalid Sheik Mohammed, when the mastermind announced he had something important to say. \u201cKSM then launched into a gory and detailed description of how he beheaded Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl,\u201d Mitchell writes.

Four children with lacerated faces, survivors of a car bomb that had set their house on fire. Another soldier, who had stumbled into a booby trap, pale on his stretcher with a hole in his chest. The luckier ones trudged past the facility in eastern Mosul, looking for shelter.",
        "HAVANA \u2014 Three generations of Cubans had an intimate psychological relationship, for better or worse, with Fidel Castro, who reshaped the country in the name of the system he called \u201cthe Revolution. \u201d He was a dominating and patriarchal figure in Cubans\u2019 public and even private lives, and he punished disobedience harshly. Out of loyalty, obligation, or perhaps a bit of both, Cubans lined up for hours Monday to pay respects to Castro in a hushed procession that was tightly choreographed by their government.",

The way he describes it, the group he helped lead since 1971 died with his longtime musical partner, Glenn Frey. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we could go out and play without the guy who started the band,\u201d says Henley.

        "What she wore doesn\u2019t matter. What she drank or smoked or snorted doesn\u2019t matter. Rape is rape, and it needs to be taken seriously even when the circumstances surrounding it are murky. It\u2019s a distinction we\u2019re still having a hard time with, apparently. The latest example: an alleged rape last month at an annual Halloween bacchanal in Georgetown. Some people were still lingering at the $5 million home known as Dodge Mansion when at least one of them heard loud cries of distress coming from the second floor. It was 4 a. m.",
        "The white man charged with killing nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, S. C. last year will be allowed to represent himself in his federal trial, a judge said Monday. This means that Dylann Roof, 22, could question survivors of the attack if they are called to testify in the case, one of two trials he faces for the massacre at Emanuel AME Church. In addition to being indicted on federal charges, Roof has been charged with murder and attempted murder in state court, and he faces potential death sentences in both trials. U. S.",

No one is complaining that the holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \u201cChrist\u201d out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \u201cTrump\u201d so that she will have to call out \u201cTrump, party of three!\u201d Religion. Politics. The Bill of Rights.

Ross Perot and NFL wide receiver Ty Montgomery.

But the vast majority of the work is either focused on political photo ops or, when it tries to go beyond that, depictions of sentiments (billboards) or just street scenes filled with veiled women or men drinking tea and smoking hookahs. Francesca Manolino\u2019s work is different, though. It is quiet, intimate and poetic. She traveled to Iran and went beyond the usual things we see.",
        "Donald Trump is planning to name investor and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary, opting for an industry insider with no government experience to helm the agency in charge of the nation\u2019s finances, according to people familiar with the matter. Mnuchin (pronounced ) joined Trump\u2019s whirlwind campaign in May as finance chairman, despite the fact that he has never worked in politics and that he donated to Democrats in the past.

        "It came across Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed early Tuesday morning, seemingly out of the blue: a demand that flag burners should face consequences, including jail and maybe even the loss of their citizenship. The Republican \u2019s tweet rattled civil liberties and legal experts, who were quick to note that the Supreme Court ruled long ago that flag desecration is considered free speech and that it is unconstitutional to punish someone by stripping their citizenship."
