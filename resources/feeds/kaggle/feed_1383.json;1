        "One of the most unbelievable races of Pat Huffman\u2019s life was winding down. Her watch suggested that she\u2019d never run faster, and she knew the finish line wasn\u2019t far away. The final stretch was the toughest. She was coughing up blood. She\u2019d fallen and gashed her knee. She was out of breath, and everything felt a bit fuzzy. Huffman knew she was making good time in the Marine Corps Historic but didn\u2019t realize that only two female runners were ahead of her \u2014 and they were both at least 15 years younger.",
        "GATLINBURG, Tenn. \u2014 A calamitous and deadly wildfire engulfed two tourist towns near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, along with much of the surrounding timberlands, destroying hundreds of homes and businesses, displacing thousands of residents and visitors, and shutting down one of the nation\u2019s most popular natural attractions. The fire killed at least three people and left at least 14 others injured, officials said Tuesday. The \u201cunprecedented\u201d fire \u2014 which started on the Chimney Tops mountain, one of the most popular hiking destinations in the Smokies \u2014 was still burning Tuesday afternoon, emergency officials said.",
        "A voting scandal of epic proportion tilted this election. The scam involved millions of people. No, I\u2019m not talking about the recount the Clinton campaign joined in Wisconsin and may seek in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton and her aides were correct before, when they said voting fraud is rare. The recounts won\u2019t change the election\u2019s outcome. And after rightly criticizing Donald Trump for saying he might not honor the election results, Clinton and her aides, who admit they have no evidence of skullduggery, risk looking hypocritical.",
        "Mark R. Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, is a member of the U. S. Senate. Modern American capitalism is not working for many Americans. That\u2019s why, no matter what your political leanings, fixing an economy that can no longer be counted on to create steady, jobs for all has to be our top priority. Whether you were heartened or heartbroken by the election results, millions of American voters have made one thing clear: There is a widespread belief that our once great institutions are unable, or at least unwilling, to work together to address today\u2019s economic challenges.",
        "Sanjar Umarov is a former political prisoner and founder of Sunshine Uzbekistan, an international political coalition aimed at improving the economic and political situation in Uzbekistan. This year, the U. S. Justice Department, in an unprecedented and bold move, seized $850 million stemming from corrupt telecom deals in Uzbekistan, most of which centered around Gulnara Karimova, the late president s daughter. The question, now, is what to do with the money \u201d a sum that represents roughly 50 percent of the country s budget.",
        "Richard Stengel, the State Department\u2019s undersecretary for public diplomacy, bluntly states the problem that has been worrying him and should worry us all: \u201cIn a global information war, how does the truth win?\u201d The very idea that the truth won\u2019t be triumphant would, until recently, have been heresy to Stengel, a former managing editor of Time magazine. But in the nearly three years since he joined the State Department, Stengel has seen the rise of what he calls a \u201c \u201d world, where the facts are sometimes overwhelmed by propaganda from Russia and the Islamic State.",

        "Sometimes history doesn\u2019t have to wait to judge \u2014 and when it comes to dictators, even dead ones, we shouldn\u2019t either. With news of Fidel Castro\u2019s death Friday \u2014 finalmente \u2014 world leaders began offering eulogies, some of which were so vapid or willfully ignorant that Castro might have written them himself. It would appear in any case that the 20th century\u2019s quintessential \u201cBig Brother\u201d managed to infect a few world leaders with an Orwellian strain of aphasia.",

This posting does not necessarily mean that Abdul Razak Ali Artan acted at the behest of the terror group, which often claims responsibility for attacks in which it had no actual involvement, said Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group.",
        "Journalists may thrive on news \u2014 by definition, the unexpected or novel \u2014 but they\u2019re terrible at getting out of their own comfortable ruts. Consider, for example, the decade or so of abject denial about their threatened business model that followed the apocalyptic arrival of Craigslist, which removed the crucial revenue that came from classified advertising. In short, we (yes, I include myself) don\u2019t handle change all that well. And now we \u2014 the traditional, the legacy, the mainstream media \u2014 have to change.",
        "Between 1940 and 1970, something remarkable happened to Asian Americans. Not only did they surpass African Americans in average household earnings, but they also closed the wage gap with whites. Many people credit this upward mobility to investments in education. But according to a recent study by Brown University economist Nathaniel Hilger, schooling rates among Asian Americans didn\u2019t change all that significantly during those three decades. Instead, Hilger\u2019s research suggests that Asian Americans started to earn more because their fellow Americans became less racist toward them.",

But on most days, its students do something that is being replicated in schools across the country: They put down their pencils, step into the great outdoors and run a mile.

        "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. \u2014 On this, almost everyone was agreed: Al Pacino was looking like a disaster as Michael Corleone. Shooting had begun in early 1971. Pacino recalls the Paramount suits looking at the rushes and saying: \u201cWhat the hell is this kid doing? And he\u2019s short to boot. \u201d They thought he was delivering an \u201canemic\u201d performance. The studio brass, Pacino says, \u201ctried to fire me three times. \u201d There \u201cwas a movement not to have me in the part,\u201d the actor recalls, sitting on the porch of his rental house in the flats of Beverly Hills.",
        "Think of this as more of a data probe by Tiger Woods than a comeback. His first competitive appearance on a golf course in nearly 16 months will be attended by a dual sense of expectation and consequence.

        "For Republicans fearful of a Donald Trump presidency, Mitt Romney was their voice and conscience. The GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee became the unyielding face of the resistance to the party\u2019s 2016 nominee. Then Trump won. One by one, Republicans who stood up to Trump or questioned his statements and antics have made a pilgrimage to Trump Tower to kiss the \u2019s ring, or joined his administration, or decided uncharacteristically to just keep their mouths shut. And at long last Tuesday night, the figurehead of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement also capitulated.",

        "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) won an eighth term leading the Democratic caucus Wednesday, prevailing in a contest that became a vote of confidence in her continued stewardship and an early proxy battle over the future of the Democratic Party. Pelosi easily beat Rep.

        "The family of Osama Hassan faced a wrenching choice as his tiny body wasted away. Should they use the little money they had, in a time of war, to take the to a hospital? Or should they buy food to feed their other children? His family chose food. Outside their hut, Ahmed Sadek grimly observed his frail grandson, who was lying on a wooden cot and staring blankly at the gray sky. His hair was sparse, his teeth decayed, his arms sticklike. He could no longer walk on his spindly legs.",
        "The officer who fatally shot a Charlotte man in September will not be charged for the shooting, prosecutors said Wednesday, concluding that the man was armed and that the officer acted lawfully during the encounter. \u201cIt\u2019s a justified shooting based on the totality of the circumstances,\u201d R.

        "Abdul Razak Ali Artan was sitting alone at a red table outside Mendenhall Lab when I met him. It was a little before 6 p. m. on Aug. 23, the first day of classes for the semester at Ohio State, and he was the first person I came across as I headed onto campus that evening. That he was alone was primarily why I approached. I was on assignment for the Lantern, looking for students for a new feature in the student newspaper called \u201cHumans of Ohio State.",
        "Democrats are in danger of moving from complacency to panic. Neither is particularly helpful. The complacency part is obvious: Until about 9 p. m. Eastern time on Nov. 8, supporters of Hillary Clinton (myself included) were certain that Donald Trump\u2019s weaknesses among women, nonwhite voters and younger Americans would prevent him from becoming president. This analysis was : Trump lost the popular vote by more than 2 million. But things went just wrong enough for Clinton in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to give Trump his victory.
