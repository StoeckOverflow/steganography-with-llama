On weeks with evening events or special programming, she might have to put in closer to 60 hours \u2014 something she says happens about once a month.

        "In an \u201cexit interview\u201d with Rolling Stone magazine, President Obama said that marijuana use should be treated as a issue similar to tobacco or alcohol and called the current patchwork of state and federal laws regarding the drug \u201cuntenable. \u201d \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been very clear about my belief that we should try to discourage substance abuse,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd I am not somebody who believes that legalization is a panacea. But I do believe that treating this as a issue, the same way we do with cigarettes or alcohol, is the much smarter way to deal with it.",
        "Here is a strategy for dealing with regulators who might shut down your product: Make it free. Scrappy car Comma. ai released a free software kit on Wednesday to help developers learn to build a device that can turn any car into an autonomous vehicle. The company, which is founded by a hacker and backed by prominent Silicon Valley investors, hopes to accelerate the development of cars while skirting the ire of Washington.

        "A terrified toddler in \u201cFrozen\u201d pajamas prodded, pulled and cried \u2014 but was powerless to wake up her mother. Mandy McGowan, 36, was unconscious from an apparent opioid overdose, sprawled in the toy aisle of a Family Dollar store in Lawrence, Mass. Her daughter pulled McGowan\u2019s fingers, then sat down beside her and tried to shake her face. The moment was captured on video, and the footage went viral \u2014 another shocking scene from the opioid epidemic\u2019s harrowing horror show. McGowan, from Salem, N.

        "Joey Abernathy III was found slumped on his toy motorcycle one winter morning in 1972. The toddler had been hit in the abdomen, causing laceration of his liver, court records say. He died on Dec. 30, 1972, at the age of 1. A murder charge was filed the following year against his mother\u2019s Gary Warwick, but was mysteriously dismissed. For four decades, the case remained unsolved \u2014 until about three years ago, when Warwick was, again, arrested and charged in the death of the boy relatives still call Baby Joey.",
        "A radar facility on the Canadian border in northwestern North Dakota. The radar site was once a regional hub of the Pinetree Line, the southernmost line of early warning radar stations charged with watching for a Soviet air attack coming over the north pole. (Matt ) At the height of the Cold War, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev boasted that the Soviets were manufacturing nuclear missiles \u201clike sausages. \u201d His bravado underscored early strategic posturing that turned on the assumption that more was better.",
        "Donald Trump has chosen retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis to be secretary of defense, according to people familiar with the decision, selecting a former senior military officer who has said that responding to \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d is the major security issue facing the United States. Mattis, who retired as chief of U. S. Central Command in 2013, has often said that Washington lacks an overall strategy in the Middle East, opting to instead handle issues in an ineffective manner.",
        "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 The raw, lingering emotion of the 2016 presidential campaign erupted into a shouting match here Thursday as top strategists of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign accused their Republican counterparts of fueling and legitimizing racism to elect Donald Trump. The extraordinary exchange came at a postmortem session sponsored by Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, where top operatives from both campaigns sat across a conference table from each other. As Trump\u2019s team basked in the glow of its victory and singled out for praise its campaign\u2019s chief executive, Stephen K.",
        "Donald Trump, on the campaign trail, would occasionally compare the criminal investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information with the case of former CIA director David Petraeus. In Trump\u2019s view, Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information, was pursued unfairly, while Clinton deserved to be treated more harshly. \u201cThe system is rigged,\u201d Trump tweeted after the FBI recommended that Clinton not be charged. \u201cGeneral Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.",
        "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Donald Trump on Thursday warned that the government would punish companies seeking to move operations overseas with \u201cconsequences,\u201d setting the stage for an unusual level of intervention by the White House into private enterprise. Trump\u2019s remarks came as he triumphantly celebrated a decision by the heating and company Carrier to reverse its plans to close a furnace plant here and move to Mexico, helping keep 1, 100 jobs in Indianapolis. About 800 of those were manufacturing positions that had been scheduled to move south of the border, said a person familiar with the negotiations.",
        "One of the best explanations of the Donald Trump 2016 phenomenon is this, via Salena Zito: \u201dThe press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally.\u201d But apparently some supporters took him both seriously and literally. And Trump, rather amazingly, is surprised by this.",
        "years ago \u2014 December 1991 \u2014 communism died, the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union disappeared. It was the largest breakup of an empire in modern history and not a shot was fired. It was an event of biblical proportions that my generation thought it would never live to see. As Wordsworth famously rhapsodized (about the French Revolution) \u201cBliss was it in that dawn to be to be young was very heaven!\u201d That dawn marked the ultimate triumph of the liberal democratic idea.",
        "Donald Trump promised to punish U. S. companies that ship manufacturing jobs out of the country. Instead, judging from the way he has handled the Carrier Corp. matter, he plans to reward them. Quite handsomely, in fact. As should be standard practice with Trump, pay attention to the substance, not the theater. United Technologies, the parent company of Carrier, has been threatening to move more than 2, 000 jobs from Indiana to Mexico. Trump addressed this specifically during his campaign, vowing to hit the company with a punitive tariff.",
        "When Donald Trump first strides into the Oval Office as president, his perfect day is likely to be ruined by a file marked \u201cNorth Korea. \u201d Trump\u2019s (first? only?) term in office may include either a messy confrontation with an unpredictable and highly combustible regime, or a rogue nation gaining the power to destroy large portions of Los Angeles with nuclear weapons. Or both. Consider the viewpoint of North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un \u2014 which is not easy since the exercise, properly done, should include platform shoes, Dennis Rodman and a \u201cpleasure squad\u201d of teen virgins.",
        "it\u2019s good that about 1, 000 Carrier Corp. workers will not be losing their jobs. But there is a whiff of Putinism in the combination of bribery and menace that may have affected Carrier\u2019s decision \u2014 the bribery of tax breaks, the menace of potential lost defense contracts for Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies. If this were to become the U. S. government\u2019s standard method of operation, the results would be Russian, too: dwindling investment, slowing economic growth, fewer jobs.",
        "The left is in a tizzy about what happens to policy under Rep. Tom Price ( .) Donald Trump\u2019s pick for health and human services secretary. Price\u2019s wish list, after all, reads like a liberal nightmare. He wants to privatize Medicare! Medicaid! Loosen the ban on refusing insurance to patients with preexisting conditions! Dismantle the insurance subsidies for poor people! Whatever the merits of these ideas, they\u2019re relatively unlikely to materialize. They\u2019re all extremely unpopular and have very vocal stakeholders standing in the way.",
        "RUSSIAN MEDDLING in Western democracies is often portrayed as malicious but centered on cyberattacks, propaganda operations and financial help for politicians. So it\u2019s worth calling attention to a couple of recent episodes in Eastern Europe that were of an entirely different character. In NATO member Hungary, Russian agents have been fingered for training with a militia; in the tiny Balkan state of Monte negro, which is on the verge of joining the transatlantic alliance, Moscow is accused of plotting a violent coup. The evidence in both cases is incomplete but compelling.",
        "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u201d The morning papers were giddy with hyperbole on Thursday over the news that Donald Trump had spoken to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by phone a day earlier and showered compliments on a country he once accused of betrayal and disrespect ? \u201d even offering to help the nuclear power solve its problems abroad. \u2030 Call me any time, Trump tells PM, ? touted the Express Tribune, describing the instant rapport ? between the two leaders during the congratulatory call initiated by Sharif. His office then released a readout of the call.",
        "LONDON \u2014 An investigation into claims of child sexual abuse involving British soccer clubs has grown to about 350 alleged cases, a police group said Thursday, as the sport\u2019s overseer opened its own inquiry into possible coverups spanning decades. The widening investigations have rocked Britain\u2019s most popular sport and its affiliated clubs, including systems of youth camps. Over the past two weeks, several former professional soccer players have come forward to recount harrowing tales of abuse that they said they suffered as children and had been kept secret for decades.",
        "Starbucks announced Thursday that Howard Schultz plans to step aside as chief executive to focus on new initiatives at the coffee giant, an abrupt change for a man widely praised for putting a once adrift company back on track and guiding it through a period of rapid global expansion. Schultz, who rarely shied away from putting Starbucks in the center of public policy debates, said he will stay on as chairman as he turns the CEO reins over to Kevin Johnson, the coffee chain\u2019s chief operating officer.",
        "Efforts to pinpoint the cause of deadly wildfires that engulfed two tourist towns outside Great Smoky Mountains National Park and shut down one of the country\u2019s most popular natural attractions focused Thursday on their devastating path through East Tennessee, where seven people have been found dead and hundreds of buildings have burned. Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller told reporters Thursday that the devastation has been \u201cunfathomable\u201d and warned that the death toll, which held steady overnight, could rise, as numerous people are still missing. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to give up hope.",
        "PARIS \u2014 Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, France\u2019s unpopular Socialist president, announced Thursday night that he would not seek reelection in 2017. \u201cI\u2019ve decided not to be a candidate to renew my mandate,\u201d he said on French television. The announcement was unusual, as Hollande is a sitting president who is nearing the end of the first of two possible terms in office. But after consistently high unemployment figures and a string of terrorist attacks that killed more than 230 people in the last two years, he became the most unpopular president in the history of modern France.",
        "We have heard many reports in the past year about the spread of the Zika virus and the extreme brain damage it can cause to unborn children, but it can be difficult to understand what that means for families. As a woman who has mothered such a child for the past 53 years, let me share some of the difficulties as well as the joys of parenting a child with microcephaly. In my son\u2019s case, microcephaly was caused by unknown factors in the first trimester of pregnancy.",
        "Princess Cruise Lines has agreed to plead guilty to seven felony charges and pay a $40 million penalty for polluting the ocean with waste and then trying to cover it up. Federal prosecutors said the payment represents the criminal penalty involving deliberate pollution by a ship at sea. Princess is a subsidiary of Carnival Corp. which owns multiple cruise lines that collectively comprise the world\u2019s biggest cruise company.",
        "Almost as soon as Donald Trump wrapped up his ostensibly meeting with TV news executives and anchors last week at Trump Tower, the New York Post\u2019s scrappy gossip column, Page Six, had the first inside account. \u201cIt was like a firing squad,\u201d an anonymous source told the column about Trump\u2019s combative remarks. \u201cThe meeting was a total disaster. \u201d Hmm. \u201cTotal disaster. \u201d Now who does that sound like?",
        "\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d is trying to do something about the liberal media echo chamber. Trevor Noah invited conservative commentator Tomi Lahren on his show last night for a lengthy debate, during which the two hashed out everything from Black Lives Matter to the Affordable Care Act to Donald Trump\u2019s recording. Lahren is the host of TheBlaze\u2019s \u201cTomi,\u201d and Noah showed a clip of her show to give his audience \u2014 who quite possibly had never seen her series \u2014 a little introduction to her viewpoints.",
        "Early in the campaign, a girl dressed as Hillary Clinton for Halloween, wearing a blazer and carrying a briefcase, met her idol. The candidate, then vying for the Democratic nomination, posed for a picture with her after an event in the girl\u2019s home town of Charleston, S. C. in 2015. Clinton told her she looked like a future president. Jennifer Jones\u2019s daughter, Sullivan, cherished the picture, now framed in her bedroom, showing a smiling Clinton crouching behind her with both hands on her little shoulders. Hillary Clinton poses with Sullivan at the event in Charleston, S. C.",
        "Donald Trump spoke Friday with Taiwan\u2019s president, a major departure from decades of U. S. policy in Asia and a breach of diplomatic protocol with ramifications for the incoming president\u2019s relations with China. The call is the first known contact between a U. S. president or with a Taiwanese leader since before the United States broke diplomatic relations with the island in 1979. China considers Taiwan a province, and news of the official outreach by Trump is likely to infuriate the regional military and economic power.",
        "Supporters of Donald Trump are moving aggressively to challenge Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein\u2019s push for a recount in three states, filing legal challenges and criticizing the effort as quixotic and . Trump and his backers have filed challenges the past two days in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which were critical to Trump\u2019s surprise victory last month because they punctured the blue wall of states expected to carry Democrat Hillary Clinton to victory. Trump narrowly won the trio of states.",
        "You may think you are prepared for a world, in which political appeals to emotion count for more than statements of verifiable fact. But now it\u2019s time to cross another bridge \u2014 into a world without facts. Or, more precisely, where facts do not matter a whit. On live radio Wednesday morning, Scottie Nell Hughes sounded breezy as she drove a stake into the heart of knowable reality: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing, unfortunately, anymore, of facts,\u201d she declared on \u201cThe Diane Rehm Show\u201d on Wednesday."
