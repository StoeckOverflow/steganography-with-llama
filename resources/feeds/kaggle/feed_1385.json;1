        "There are many aspects of the economic policy of the new administration that I find misguided. But I am most troubled by what Donald Trump did with Carrier to hold on to an extra 700 jobs in Indiana. Ronald Reagan\u2019s response to the air traffic controllers\u2019 strike was a small act that had profound consequences. I fear in a similar way that the negotiation with Carrier is a small thing that is actually a very big thing \u2014 a change very much for the worse with regards to the operating assumptions of American capitalism.",
        "Determined not to let any Trump action go unchallenged, the media has been full of comments from economists (including Larry Summers and Justin Wolfers) that Donald Trump\u2019s intervention to save jobs at Carrier\u2019s Indiana facility is just a showman\u2019s \u2014 that it can\u2019t be easily replicated and will be ultimately ineffective in changing the job prospects in a country that creates and destroys a couple of million jobs every month. This is simply not the way things are done in a country that values free markets and the rule of law. Methinks they are missing the story.",
        "CINCINNATI \u2014 Susan Meyer becomes giddy as she explains just how excited she is for Donald Trump to take office. Her tone changes at the mention of \u201csecretary of state. \u201d Meyer trusts Trump, but she simply doesn\u2019t understand why he would put Mitt Romney on his shortlist to head the State Department. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t like Romney; she voted for him in 2012 and considers him fully capable. But how could Trump forget the things Romney said about him during the primary? Why would he trust someone like that?",
        "There may never in American history have been a president who tried harder to unify the country, and got as little credit for it from his opponents, as Barack Obama. Despite being unfailingly thoughtful and always insisting political disagreements weren\u2019t personal, Obama was portrayed by Republicans as some kind of rage monster whose only goal was to set Americans against each other. They attacked him for not being enough of a unifier while simultaneously accusing him of intentionally trying to destroy the country.",
        "As Democrats contemplate their losses in November\u2019s election, most have settled on a solution. They believe that the party needs more economically populist policies. But this misses an essential reality: Most people don\u2019t vote on the basis of policies. There is excellent research by political scientists and psychologists on why people vote. The conclusion is clear. As Gabriel Lenz writes in his landmark 2012 book, \u201cFollow the Leader?\u201d \u201cVoters don\u2019t choose between politicians based on policy stances; rather, voters appear to adopt the policies that their favorite politicians prefer. \u201d And how do voters pick their favorite politicians?",
        "It is a sign of how secretive the new administration plans to be that when Donald Trump spoke this week with the Pakistani prime minister, Americans learned what was discussed not from their but from the oppressive Pakistani government\u2019s Ministry of Information. Luckily, ministry Press Release No. 298 \u2014 Pakistan\u2019s official \u201creadout\u201d of the phone call \u2014 so perfectly captured the \u2019s way of speaking that there can be little doubt it is close to a verbatim account.",
        "Congratulations! The American people have given you the formidable responsibility of assembling a Cabinet. The best Cabinet ever, you promised! And with none of the problems of previous Cabinets. And without any ties to plutocrats or the grotesque handful of corporations, like Goldman Sachs, that are squeezing the life out of the American people. You will not let the American people down! 1. Surreptitiously Google \u201cWhat is a Cabinet?\u201d 2. The first thing that comes up is some sort of rap battle from that cursed musical \u201cHamilton. \u201d 3. Okay. This is fine. You can do this. 4.",
        "The job of a president\u2019s national security adviser often resembles the challenge of jaywalking across an boulevard without being run over. The jockeying among Cabinet members, the grinding interagency process, the traps and manholes that arise, not to mention crisis management, are enough to fray the nerves of even the steeliest aide. President Carter\u2019s national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was awakened at home just after 2:26 a. m. on June 3, 1980. He was told that two intercontinental ballistic missiles were headed toward the United States. After the first signals, the displays showed even more missiles coming.",
        "If they ever remake that 1958 classic \u201cThe Fly,\u201d Mitt Romney should play the fly and Donald Trump the spider that comes to eat him. \u201cHelp me, help me,\u201d the fly cries as the spider moves in for the kill. Only in real life, nothing can help Romney. Instead of being a creature with the head of a man and the body of a fly, he has the head of a man and the quivering body of a jellyfish. It\u2019s a different movie, I grant you \u2014 but still horrible to watch. Once, Romney was all man.",
        "IRONDALE, Ala. \u2014 They have put it off all spring and summer, but now it\u2019s autumn and they\u2019re out of excuses, so they set out on what should be the most ordinary of chores: to dismantle a trampoline in one back yard and rebuild it in another. \u201cI love you,\u201d the boy says as they drive through their neighborhood, just after his mother, who awoke with another migraine, told him to \u201cshut up and sit on your butt or else.",
        "Billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein has agreed to fund an overhaul of the Washington Monument\u2019s broken elevator system, but the beleaguered landmark will probably remain closed for the next 2 years, the National Park Service says. It is the second time that Rubenstein has come to the aid of the monument, which has been shuttered since Aug. 17 because of chronic elevator problems. After the 2011 earthquake, he donated $7. 5 million of the $15 million cost of repairing the obelisk.",
        "A year after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others, authorities are still probing the shooting and trying to answer lingering questions about what happened. Since the rampage, the FBI has waged a fight with Apple over accessing a phone used by one of the terrorists, pleaded with the public for information and charged people related to the shooters with other crimes unearthed during the investigation. But a year after one of the deadliest attacks in the United States since Sept.",
        "VIENNA \u2014 He is a political disrupter supported by websites that traffic in fake news. His campaign\u2019s embrace of rumor defied the rules of electoral civility, turning the presidential race into the bitterest in decades. His country is Austria, and his name is Norbert Hofer. Austrians go the polls Sunday in a rerun presidential election following a campaign displaying remarkable similarities to populist politics on both sides of the Atlantic. It is as if Hofer \u2014 from the nationalist, Freedom Party \u2014 is reading from the same winning playbook as Donald Trump. Take, for example, the question of \u201cstamina.",
        "CITY | This is part of a continuing series that will examine issues related to repeat violent offenders in the District of Columbia. Part I | Part II Hundreds of criminals sentenced by D. C. judges under an obscure local law crafted to give second chances to young adult offenders have gone on to rob, rape or kill residents of the nation\u2019s capital. The original intent of the law was to rehabilitate inexperienced criminals under the age of 22.",
        "The U. S. economy added 178, 000 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate fell to 4. 6 percent, a level not seen since August 2007, according to government data released Friday morning. The first employment report since voters went to the polls last month shows an economy in strong shape as Donald Trump prepares to take office. \u201cIt looks like firms are pretty bullish about what they\u2019re going to see in 2017 and are continuing their strong hiring of the past few years,\u201d said Steve Rick, chief economist at insurance company CUNA Mutual Group.",
        "Minutes before Holland America\u2019s Nieuw Amsterdam was scheduled to depart for Fort Lauderdale, Berit and Dan Wick received an urgent call at home. Without delay, the couple hailed a taxi to the port terminal in Cartagena, Colombia. Once aboard the vessel, Dan approached an American stretched out on a hospital bed surrounded by the ship\u2019s doctors and nurses. The woman was pale and struggling to breathe; an oxygen mask covered her face. Her waited by the gangplank, filled with worry and concern. Dan accompanied Sue Wright in the ambulance, a bumpy ride along cobblestone roads.",
        "The tattered Pearl Harbor survivor looks every bit of 78, with weathered skin, rusty bones and the faded \u201cU. S. Navy\u201d emblem the old bird got before the war. Gray from age and years in the service, the veteran of Dec. 7 sits with other World War II antiques, weary and in need of attention. But with the 75th anniversary of the 1941 attack this week, and commemorations scheduled in Hawaii and around the country, this survivor, like most who were there that day, has a story.",
        "There is limited space to dry fish in Elmina, so they are dried on the ground. (Tomasz Tomaszewski) Editor\u2019s note: Quotes and captions have been edited for clarity. Elmina is a picturesque, historic fishing community dating back to the 1400s. It is one of the first European settlements in West Africa located on the bay on the Atlantic Ocean coast of Ghana. While passing through Elmina, photographer Tomasz Tomaszewski was intrigued by the beautiful landscape and the coastal fisherman\u2019s artisanal way of life. So he went there to document what he saw.",
        "Just two weeks ago, Donald Trump appeared poised to assemble a Cabinet as unconventional as he is, drawing heavily from a band of quirky loyalists that included several from the fringes of the Republican Party. But as he moves rapidly toward assembling his roster of top advisers, Trump instead is pulling together a more orthodox GOP team than many expected, including a defense secretary nominee, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who has received solid marks from the party establishment ahead of his formal unveiling Monday.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 On Friday, President Xi Jinping told Henry Kissinger that he hoped for \u201cstability\u201d in U. S. ties under the new administration. Nobody told Donald Trump. The broke with four decades of diplomatic practice by talking on the phone Friday with Taiwanese President Tsai a breach of protocol that could disrupt U. S. ties before the inauguration. The phone call is believed to be the first time that a U. S. president or and a Taiwanese leader have spoken since the late 1970s.",
        "One of the chief concerns of Donald Trump\u2019s detractors during the presidential campaign was that the brash and notoriously real estate executive wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the delicate balancing act that is diplomacy. It\u2019s one thing to make wild claims domestically; it\u2019s another to inflame a fellow world power with a careless word or two. Today, a fellow world power \u2014 China \u2014 is inflamed. And Trump\u2019s controversial conversation with Taiwan\u2019s leader, which broke nearly four decades of protocol when it comes to U. S.",
        "Every four years, the Institute of Politics at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government assembles the managers of the presidential campaigns for a deep, debrief. It is always illuminating and generally civil, with occasional fireworks. Because the 2016 election was unlike any other, this year\u2019s managers conference was also unlike any other. In the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory over former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, all the leading players said the right things. Trump called for healing and said that he would try to bring the country together.",
        "OAKLAND \u2014 California officials fear dozens may have died in a massive fire that swept through an Oakland warehouse where a concert was taking place Friday night. Nine people have been confirmed dead, and dozens of others remain missing, officials said. In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they expected the death toll to rise, but they did not know by how much. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting the worse \u2014 maybe a couple dozen victims here,\u201d Sgt. Ray Kelly, spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office, told reporters.",
        "On the first stop of his \u201cthank you\u201d tour in Ohio on Thursday, Donald Trump hit replay on several of his campaign tropes. Among the crowd pleasers, he heckled the \u201ccrooked media,\u201d prompting boos from the audience, and reiterated his pledge to criminalize flag burning. And he\u2019s not even president yet. More than a month and a half away from Inauguration Day, Trump\u2019s only discipline seems to be making good on bad faith. His attacks both on the media and on those who, rather rarely, burn an American flag, are fundamentally assaults on the Constitution and the First Amendment.",
        "Welcome to \u2014 brace yourself for \u2014 the presidency. \u201cFacts are stubborn things,\u201d said John Adams in 1770, defending British soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre, \u201cand whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence. \u201d Or so we thought, until we elected to the presidency a man consistently heedless of truth and impervious to .",
        "The word \u201cinappropriate\u201d is increasingly used inappropriately. It is useful to describe departures from good manners and other social norms, such as wearing white after Labor Day and using the salad fork with the entree. But the adjective has become a splatter of verbal fudge, a weasel word falsely suggesting measured seriousness. Its misty imprecision does not disguise but advertises the user\u2019s moral obtuseness. A French court has demonstrated how \u201cinappropriate\u201d can be an device of intellectual evasion and moral cowardice.",
        "The D. C. Council, having relegated the mission of oversight to a back seat, has become a legislative laboratory for the left \u201d with the resultant costs to be borne by District taxpayers. Let us pause, draw nigh to council chambers and listen to the scream of protest: Vigorous oversight of D. C. government operations is essential to our being. \u2030 Tis a duty we cherish above all. ? Rather than actively overseeing the operation of city programs and services, our legislators seem bent on taking revenge upon what they apparently regard as a scourge of the earth: D.",
        "Kate Walsh is president of the National Council on Teacher Quality. Here\u2019s something I\u2019ve been struggling to understand: What makes the prospect of a national teacher shortage such an immediately compelling narrative, capable of spreading with the speed of a brush fire? With almost no real data \u2014 because neither states nor the federal government collects the information that would be needed to pronounce the onset of a true teacher shortage \u2014 we witness the press, school districts, state school boards and even Congress conclude that we are in the throes of a national crisis.",
        "David Holahan is a writer living in East Haddam, Conn. I love to watch the birds, but some days I despair. After meandering for an hour about fields, streams and forests, I often see nothing \u2014 or the equivalent: only juncos, aptly named, or common sparrows. I try to comfort myself with other natural sights and sounds, but my mind won\u2019t have it. Where are the avian rock stars? Like those winsome warblers? Whither the preposterous pileated woodpecker (the real Woody Woodpecker)? If a scarlet tanager makes a cameo once a year, one is supposed to be grateful.",
        "HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 A Green campaign changed its strategy to force a statewide recount of Pennsylvania\u2019s Nov. 8 presidential election, won by Republican Donald Trump, and said late Saturday night that it will seek help in the federal courts, rather than the state courts. The announcement that it would seek an emergency federal court order on Monday for a recount came hours after it dropped a case in the state courts."
