        "A jury deadlocked Monday in the case of a former South Carolina police officer charged with murder after he was recorded on video last year firing a barrage of bullets at the back of Walter Scott, a fleeing driver, in one of the most shootings to rattle the nation in recent years. \u201cWe as the jury regret to inform the court that despite the best efforts of all members, we are unable to come to a unanimous decision,\u201d the jury wrote in a note that Circuit Court Judge Clifton Newman read aloud in the courtroom.",
        "I was home with my family Sunday afternoon when an email arrived from a reader with a proposal. He wanted to lynch me. \u201cRope, Tree, Journalist,\u201d the man wrote. \u201cSome assembly required. \u201d To this slogan, made popular by Donald Trump supporters wore at his rallies, my hangman added his offer: \u201cI will assemble for you. \u201d This bit of, er, gallows humor was the latest, though far from the worst, of the sort of correspondence my colleagues and I have been receiving lately.",
        "Terrell Jermaine Starr is a freelance journalist in New York City who specializes in . S. affairs and national security. You can follow him on Twitter: @Russian_Starr. In 1930, Robert Robinson left his job at Ford Motor Company in Detroit to work as an engineer in Soviet Moscow. Robinson, who was born in Jamaica and grew up in Cuba, had hoped to avoid the racism he faced in the United States. He was immediately disappointed.

        "We\u2019ve never had a president whose business created as many potential conflicts of interest as Donald Trump, and at the same time we\u2019ve never had a president who cared less about conflicts of interest as Donald Trump. Indeed, he and his children are making it quite clear that they will use the presidency as a tool to make as much money as they can. And Republicans, particularly members of Congress, have apparently decided that if Trump does it, it\u2019s okay.",
        "We find it predictable that Democrats should seek \u201cpayback\u201d for the GOP Senate\u2019s refusal to hold confirmation hearings on Merrick Garland to fill the seat vacated by Antonin Scalia\u2019s untimely death. We learn: \u201cMultiple Democratic senators told Politico in interviews last week that after watching Republicans sit on Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court for nearly a year, they\u2019re in no mood to Trump\u2019s selections. \u201d As a matter of good politics and good governance, we would suggest that the Senate Democrats separate the nominees into three categories.",
        "As Republicans barrel headlong towards repealing the Affordable Care Act, new factoids and data are slowly dribbling out to reveal just what a mess they are about to make, including for countless numbers of their own constituents. The latest: The Kaiser Family Foundation today released a new study breaking down how many people in each state are benefiting from the ACA\u2019s subsidies to buy health insurance on the individual market \u2014 and how much money people in each state are getting.",
        "Relax. Breathe. Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with the president of Taiwan wasn\u2019t a blunder by an inexperienced unschooled in the niceties of diplomacy. It was a deliberate move \u2014 and a brilliant one at that. The phone call with President Tsai was reportedly carefully planned, and Trump was fully briefed before the call, according to The Post. It\u2019s not that Trump was unfamiliar with the \u201cThree Communiques\u201d or unaware of the fiction that there is \u201cOne China. \u201d Trump knew precisely what he was doing in taking the call.",

The document outlines eight years of the administration\u2019s legal opinions, executive orders and military directives. In a strong defense of the administration\u2019s actions, it lists rules for lethal drones and terrorist detention, and describes the international and domestic law that undergirds them.

        "It\u2019s official: The last \u2014 and most heated \u2014 outstanding gubernatorial race of the year has come to a close, with incumbent GOP Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina conceding in a Monday video message to Democratic challenger Roy Cooper: \u201cDespite continued questions that should be answered regarding the voting process, I personally believe that the majority of our citizens have spoken,\u201d McCrory said.

Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley told reporters at a Monday news conference that while many have asked what kind of criminal charges might be available the case, it remains too early to speculate, but that a murder or involuntary manslaughter charges were possible. \u201cRight now, we have just started our investigation,\u201d she said.",

        "LONDON \u2014 The British people spoke in June: They want out of the European Union. But more than five months after the country\u2019s referendum, the question of who actually gets to pull the trigger on Brexit remains a muddle. Prime Minister Theresa May says she does. A British court argued otherwise last month, ruling that Parliament must have a say. Now it\u2019s up to the U. K. Supreme Court, which on Monday began hearing arguments in a case that could complicate May\u2019s plan to set in motion Britain\u2019s exit by the end of March.",
        "With baseball\u2019s winter meetings right here along the shores of the Potomac River, it\u2019s time for Washington to arrive at what could be a difficult realization: Bryce Harper will be a National in 2017, and he will be a National in 2018. After that, he won\u2019t be. And that provides the framework not just for what will transpire at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center this week, but for who the Nationals will be for the next two years.",
        "ROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s parties vowed Monday to join forces with other insurgents around Europe as Prime Minister Matteo Renzi prepared to resign, but it was unclear whether an unlikely alliance of disaffected voters could propel the populists to office. Italy plunged into political uncertainty Monday after the decisive defeat of Renzi\u2019s signature constitutional revision plan, which was meant to strengthen his hand and defuse the movement.

Part I | Part II | Part III On a warm summer night, Kristin Van Goor was jolted awake by the sound of knocking. She hurried down the wooden staircase in her pajamas.

        "Donald Trump sold all his shares in companies in June, his spokesman said Tuesday, a move that could have created a cash windfall as he ramped up to begin a costly general election presidential campaign that at the time he claimed he would personally support with \u201cmajor contributions. \u201d The could help address worries about his stock portfolio, a sizable part of Trump\u2019s financial life that was worth roughly as much as $40 million as of December 2015, a May disclosure filing shows.",

        "Is America becoming a rogue state? The State Department stopped using the term years ago to describe the likes of Iran and North Korea, figuring it was needlessly provocative. But it would seem the incoming Trump administration plans to handle its affairs \u2014 domestic and foreign \u2014 in a manner that meets the dictionary definition of a \u201crogue state\u201d as one \u201cthat conducts its policy in a dangerously unpredictable way. \u201d Even before Donald Trump threw relations into a new round of turmoil by speaking with the Taiwanese leader and by trolling a nation of 1.",

Keith Ellison ( .) over his attitudes toward Jews and Israel have picked up steam. Running for chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, Ellison is but the latest public figure with views that depart from the hawkish dogma of the traditional establishment to find his personal credibility and qualification for high office under fire.

        "Whatever else future historians say about Donald Trump\u2019s early foreign policy moves, they\u2019re likely to note the erratic and, in many ways, nature of the \u2019s initial dealings with China, the country many analysts view as the United States\u2019 most important rival. Devising a wise strategy for challenging China\u2019s ascendancy in Asia is arguably the top foreign policy task for a new president.
