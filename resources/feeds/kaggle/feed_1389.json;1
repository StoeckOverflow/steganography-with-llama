Ryan ( .) was one of the most passionate and eloquent defenders of House Republicans\u2019 multipronged investigations of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions as secretary of state.

        "Senate Democrats are threatening to force a brief government shutdown this weekend to pressure Republicans to support policies they say match promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail to help coal country and boost American manufacturers. Government funding is set to run out at the end of Friday and lawmakers are currently considering a stopgap spending bill that would keep federal agencies funded through April 28. The angry Democrats are not threatening to block the spending measure, but to threaten to miss the Friday deadline in hopes they can entice Republicans into further negotiations.",

        "If you\u2019re still confused about why Democrats lost the election, look no further than the issues they prioritize. Instead of focusing on jobs, the economy and national security, the Democrats obsess over climate change, bathroom breaks and, curiously, sanctuary cities. Now is a good time for the Republicans to pick some fights, and the issue of sanctuary cities is a prime target. It\u2019s a perfect reminder of what Democrats have become.
