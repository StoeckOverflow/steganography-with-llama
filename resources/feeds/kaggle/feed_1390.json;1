        "House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) reportedly met with Donald Trump today about his top agenda items, namely \u201cdismantling Obamacare, securing the border and the economy. \u201d If Ryan wanted to do the Congress and the country a favor, here is what we hope he said about Obamacare: Mr. we all ran on getting rid of it \u2014 in fact, getting rid of all of it. But 20 million or so people are on it. You promised something \u201cterrific\u201d instead, so what is it? You don\u2019t have anything specific in mind, you say?",
        "Ellen L. Weintraub is a member of the Federal Election Commission. The White House counsel operates out of the public eye but has the president\u2019s ear. In the Trump administration, with the unprecedented multiplicity of challenges facing the the job will take on added importance. As a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Election Commission, I served five years alongside Donald F. McGahn, Donald Trump\u2019s choice for the post. My experience may be instructive \u2014 and disquieting.",
        "As of Jan. 20, Chuck Schumer will be the most important Democrat in the land. But spend a few minutes with the incoming Senate minority leader and it\u2019s clear where the real power lies. I was interviewing the New York Democrat in his Capitol hideaway office this week when he paused to take a call on his archaic flip phone. It was about an event scheduled for the next day to highlight a new initiative tallying jobs \u201coutsourced\u201d overseas during the Trump presidency. Schumer had one question: \u201cIs Bernie coming?\u201d \u201cHe told me he\u2019d come,\u201d Schumer continued.",
        "THE WEEK started with a hopeful sign for those concerned about climate change: Former vice president Al Gore met with Donald Trump for about 90 minutes on Monday, leading some to believe that the might be ready to accept facts and evidence. By the end of the week, however, Mr. Trump had selected Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (R) to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitt wrote this in National Review in May: \u201cGlobal warming has inspired one of the major policy debates of our time. That debate is far from settled.",
        "Senate Democrats used a standoff over a spending bill to appeal to the white voters they lost to Donald Trump by threatening a short government shutdown over issues important to them. Democrats relented late Friday and agreed to allow a vote on the spending measure hours before government funding was set to expire at midnight. The bill is expected to be cleared for President Obama\u2019s signature before that deadline, avoiding a shutdown. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to shut down the government,\u201d said incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.). \u201cWe\u2019ve made our point.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 In a recent tweet, a German lawmaker used a highly specific term to describe her angst. Suggesting her country\u2019s national identity was under threat, she cried \u201cUmvolkung\u201d \u2014 a word roughly translated as \u201cethnic conversion. \u201d It is also a word that was last in vogue when Adolf Hitler ruled the land, and its appropriation by a politician from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s ruling party sparked a raucous uproar. Yet the tweet highlighted the term\u2019s resurgence in Germany \u2014 where a glossary of a terms long associated with the Nazis are staging a comeback.",
        "About a year ago, college student Lauren Batchelder stood up at a political forum in New Hampshire and told Donald Trump that she didn\u2019t think he was \u201ca friend to women. \u201d The next morning, Trump fired back on Twitter \u2014 calling Batchelder an \u201carrogant young woman\u201d and accusing her of being a \u201cplant\u201d from a rival campaign. Her phone began ringing with callers leaving threatening messages that were often sexual in nature. Her Facebook and email inboxes filled with similar messages.",
        "LONDON \u2014 A Dutch court found politician Geert Wilders guilty Friday of insulting an ethnic group and inciting discrimination after he led chants against Moroccans, a conviction he promptly denounced as \u201cmadness. \u201d Wilders, the controversial leader of the Netherlands\u2019 Freedom Party (PVV) said he plans to appeal the verdict delivered by a panel of three \u201chating\u201d judges. His party is leading in polls ahead of the country\u2019s upcoming general election in March. \u201cThree PVV hating judges declare that Moroccans are a race and convict me and half of the Netherlands.",
        "President Obama has authorized a pay increase for federal employees, just in time for the Christmas bills. In letters to the House and Senate, Obama authorized an average pay raise for 2017 of 2. 1 percent, instead of the 1. 6 percent he submitted in August. \u201cHowever, in light of the decision of Congress to provide a 2.",
        "Well before he exited the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, John Glenn flew at least 149 combat missions \u2014 59 during World War II and 90 during the Korean War. It must have been difficult on his wife, Annie Glenn (maiden name, Castor). To ease her fear, before each mission Glenn would utter the same words: \u201cI\u2019m just going down to the corner store to get a pack of gum. \u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be long,\u201d she would always respond.

        "When Charles Darwin examined an orchid from Madagascar with a nearly nectary, he was certain that a corresponding moth, one with an exceptionally long proboscis must exist. More than two decades after Darwin died, a moth matching this specification was identified. And more than 80 years after that, it was further confirmed: The Xanthopan morganii was documented feeding on this exact flower. This moth is one of the fascinating examples of the extraordinary ways in which plants and animals have adapted elegant solutions for survival, collected in photographer Robert Clark\u2019s new work, \u201cEvolution\u201d (Phaidon) with text by Joseph Wallace.",
        "Donald Trump is expected to name as his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, who has worked extensively around the globe and built relationships with such leaders as Russian President Vladi mir Putin, three people close to the transition team confirmed Saturday. Tillerson\u2019s nomination could face intense scrutiny in the Senate, considering his years of work in Russia and the Middle East on behalf of the multinational petroleum company. Already, two leading Republican hawks, Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.",
        "So far, Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks have mostly been either multimillionaire and billionaire executives or retired generals. In that context, it\u2019s probably less of a surprise that Trump may be close to selecting ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, elevating a prospect who may surge past seasoned political actors like Mitt Romney and Sen. Bob Corker ( .) in the stretch. Tillerson\u2019s hardly an unknown character on the world stage, but he\u2019s probably not too familiar to Americans.",
        "The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U. S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, according to U. S. officials.",
        "This post has been updated with a defiant statement from the Trump transition team. The Washington Post is now reporting that the CIA has concluded something widely suspected but never flatly stated by the intelligence community: that Russia moved deliberately to help elect Donald Trump as president of the United States \u2014 not just to undermine the U. S. political process more generally. The Post\u2019s report cites officials who say they have identified individuals connected to the Russian government who gave WikiLeaks emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and top Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta.",
        "The CIA\u2019s findings that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency are both \u201cstunning and not surprising,\u201d the next leader of Senate Democrats said, raising the need for Congress to conduct a full investigation. The statement from Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) issued Saturday morning, was in response to a Washington Post story that intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee to boost Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances.",
        "Every year, my fellow movie reviewers and I bemoan the current state of cinema \u2014 Too many flicks! Not enough substance! Where are the flicks of yore? Wah, I\u2019m bored! \u2014 only to realize that, when it\u2019s time to compile our lists, we\u2019re (once again) spoiled for choice.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Islamic State militants fought their way back into the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra on Saturday nine months after they were driven out by Syrian government forces, in a reminder that the group is still a force to be reckoned with despite major losses of territory elsewhere. The advance into Palmyra seemed set to reverse a year of steady defeats for Islamic State fighters and came three days after a big offensive launched from three directions in the surrounding desert.",
        "In third grade, I received a school assignment to interview a family member. I chose my mother, who had immigrated to the United States after marrying my white American father. We began with a simple question. \u201cWhere were you born?\u201d \u201cTaiwan,\u201d my mother answered. No, I argued. I had seen it with my own eyes: \u201cRepublic of China\u201d in sharp black ink on the letters and packages my grandmother sent. I insisted that she was from China.",
        "U. S. relations have never been easy. No problem in the world can be solved without the pair working together, but working together is hard. The relationship is set for more uncertainty with the election of Donald Trump. On Dec. 2, Trump took a call from the democratically elected president of Taiwan, breaking decades of precedent. The call raised fears that Trump would take a hard line on China. But then, unpredictable as ever, the announced Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as his pick for ambassador to Beijing. Branstad reportedly has a close personal relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
        "Lally Weymouth is a senior associate editor for The Washington Post. To say that Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is prepared for his new job as Peru\u2019s president is an understatement. Kuczynski, 78, has been finance minister and prime minister; a technocrat at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; an investment banker and founder of a fund. Last year he relinquished his U. S. citizenship to run for president.",
        "Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election and will be the next president of the United States. As I have written before in these pages, the rules of the game for choosing our presidents need to be changed, but that discussion concerns future elections, not this past one. A win is a win. That most people acknowledge Trump\u2019s victory should now free us to have a serious discussion about the role of foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.",
        "MADISON \u2014 Democrats continue to digest last month\u2019s election results and probably will do so for months to come. The devastation of losing a presidential contest most Democrats thought they would win has been compounded by the decimation of the party at all levels that has occurred since President Obama was first elected. Advisers to Hillary Clinton have noted, correctly, that in an election that turned on a relatively few number of votes in a handful of northern industrial states, there are many possible answers, all with some validity, for why she lost.",
        "MGM\u2019s new casino sits seven miles south of the White House and is filled with hat tips and homages to life in the nation\u2019s capital. George Washington\u2019s dignified mug is plastered outside toilets. One bar is meant to evoke the National Archives. Another, the Blossom lounge, has hanging pink lights shaped like the area\u2019s iconic cherry trees. There are even shameless land grabs, as with the marketing of the MGM National Harbor\u2019s showy Chairman Suite. \u201cThese are the 3, 210 most coveted square feet in Washington,\u201d the booking site reads breathlessly.

        "ISTANBUL \u2014 A car packed with explosives detonated Saturday night at the entrance of a soccer stadium in central Istanbul, authorities said, injuring about 20 people and sending a plume of smoke over the city in the latest in a string of terrorist attacks in the country. The bomb, which could be heard across Istanbul, exploded outside the Vodafone Arena in the Beskitas area of Istanbul, less than a mile from the city\u2019s bustling Taksim Square and on the edge of the Bosporus.",
        "A member of Congress who served as a Marine in Iraq said he has been called \u201ceverything you can under the sun\u201d by fellow veterans for his decision to oppose retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis becoming defense secretary, but he stands by his choice. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D. .) who became a congressman last year, said he has been insulted repeatedly by fellow combat veterans, with some inaccurately calling him \u201cPOG,\u201d a derisive acronym that stands for \u201cperson other than grunt\u201d and implies he did not serve in the infantry.",
        "As Syrian fighters push toward the Islamic State\u2019s capital of Raqqa in northern Syria, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter announced Saturday that additional U. S. Special Operations forces will head into the country to help the fledgling offensive. The additional 200 troops will bolster the 300 or so already in the country, although the number is likely to fluctuate as forces move between Syria and neighboring Iraq. Carter, speaking at a conference in Bahrain, said the forces would include trainers, advisers and explosives specialists. Other western countries, such as France, also have Special Operations units in the country.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 For the first time in 15 years, Navy was first to sing its alma mater after its game against Army. That gloomy distinction falls to the loser of one of college football\u2019s most storied rivalries, one the Midshipmen had owned since installing the offense. But that typically efficient rushing attack hardly got on track Saturday afternoon at M&T Bank Stadium, with Navy pinning its fortunes upon a quarterback making the first start of his career.",

ESPN was thrust into the spotlight in November when the ratings company Nielsen predicted the sports juggernaut would lose 621, 000 cable subscribers that month."
