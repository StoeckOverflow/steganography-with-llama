        "Atop the ice sheet covering the Arctic island of Greenland, you now see dramatic melting in the summer. It forms lakes, rivers and even dangerous \u201cmoulins\u201d in the ice where rivers suddenly plunge into the thick ice sheet, carrying water deep below. East Antarctica is supposed to be different. It is extremely remote and cold. It doesn\u2019t see such warm temperatures in the summer \u2014 yet \u2014 and so its ice tends to remain more pristine.",
        "The 2017 Golden Globe nominations are in, and yes, \u201cLa La Land\u201d and the FX series \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson\u201d predictably lead the motion picture and television pack. But, inevitably, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association managed to serve up some surprising nods and snubs for the awards show, which serves as an Oscars predictor. Here\u2019s a look: TV shows that once got love get passed over After two consecutive years of getting nominations, HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d didn\u2019t nab one in the best TV series, comedy. \u201cMr.",
        "President Obama has been determining what he\u2019ll work on once he leaves the White House and now he has a place to do it. Obama has agreed to lease office space in the headquarters building of the World Wildlife Fund, at 1250 24th St. NW in the West End, according to two people familiar with the agreement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been announced publicly. WWF, a nonprofit organization focused on environmental conservation, owns the building and leases excess space to other organizations.",
        "After 35 years on the job, Michael Stuban was minutes away from retiring from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. Only one thing stood in his way: emailing his exit questionnaire to the Human Resources Department. Stuban had already decided to use the questionnaire to get a few things off his chest, penning a brutally frank assessment of his colleagues and bosses and how they functioned inside the agency. Now, the stood at a crossroads.",
        "Two shots of bitter cold air blast into the Lower 48 this week. In some areas, temperatures will drop more than 30 degrees below normal with punishing wind chills well below zero. The first shot of cold air arrives as a piece of the polar vortex is unleashed from the Arctic, tumbling southeastward across Canada over the next few days. A second lobe of the vortex breaks off and dips south over the weekend. The first wave Cold air has already begun to spill into the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest where temperatures hovered near zero Monday morning.",
        "Donald Trump has picked as his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, Trump\u2019s transition team announced Tuesday, setting up a possible confrontation with members of his own party in the Senate. Since Tillerson\u2019s name emerged as a candidate for the post, leading Republicans have expressed reservations about his years of work in Russia and the Middle East on behalf of the multinational oil company. But some lawmakers seemed to be signaling they will support him after the announcement was made.",
        "Congressional leaders are vowing to vigorously probe allegations that Russia interfered in the elections to benefit Donald J. Trump, but they are already arguing over who should do so and how any examination should be conducted. Senior Republicans want to channel any investigation through the House and Senate intelligence committees, over which they have greater control. But some Democrats, fearing that the results of such an investigation would never be released to the public, are pushing the formation of an independent body of outsiders modeled on the Sept. 11 commission.",
        "Donald Trump has tapped Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who has represented Montana\u2019s congressional seat for one term, to serve as secretary of the Department of the Interior, according to an individual with firsthand knowledge of the decision. Zinke, who studied geology as an undergraduate at the University of Oregon and served as a Navy SEAL from 1986 to 2008 before entering politics, campaigned for his House seat on a platform of achieving North American energy independence. He sits on the House Natural Resources Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee.",
        "Donald Trump has picked Rick Perry to head the Energy Department, said two people familiar with the decision, seeking to put the former Texas governor in control of an agency whose name he forgot during a presidential debate even as he vowed to abolish it. Perry, who ran for president in the past two election cycles, is likely to shift the department away from renewable energy and toward fossil fuels, whose production he championed while serving as governor for 14 years. The Energy Department was central to the 2011 gaffe that helped end his first presidential bid.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Joe Scarborough knew he had Donald Trump\u2019s ear. And so, in the fall of 2015, not long after the businessman launched a presidential campaign, the MSNBC host sat him down for a lecture. Things were about to \u201cget real,\u201d Scarborough says he told the newbie politician. It didn\u2019t matter that they had golfed together or laughed together during Trump\u2019s many jolly, blustering cameos on Scarborough\u2019s freewheeling talk shows.",
        "Alarmed that decades of crucial climate measurements could vanish under a hostile Trump administration, scientists have begun a feverish attempt to copy reams of government data onto independent servers in hopes of safeguarding it from any political interference. The efforts include a \u201cguerrilla archiving\u201d event in Toronto, where experts will copy irreplaceable public data, meetings at the University of Pennsylvania focused on how to download as much federal data as possible in the coming weeks, and a collaboration of scientists and database experts who are compiling an online site to harbor scientific information.",
        "Two weeks ago, Donald Trump promised to hold a news conference Thursday that would detail how he intends to deal with his business operations while president. There remain huge questions about him handing over control to his children and increasing concerns about conflicts of interest. But now the news conference is off \u2014 delayed until next month, his team said. This happens a lot. Trump, as Philip Bump noted back in August, often promises something will happen in a few weeks. Then it doesn\u2019t. And then sometimes it never happens.",

        "Philip K. Howard is chair of the group Common Good and author of \u201cThe Rule of Nobody. \u201d On Fox News on Sunday, Donald Trump lamented that those seeking government permits sometimes \u201care waiting in line for 15 years,\u201d sometimes only to get rejected in the end, and vowed to speed up the process. To succeed, he\u2019ll need a new approach to governing. Every president since Jimmy Carter has vowed to cut unnecessary regulations, but the machine has defied all attempts at control.",
        "Jeffrey Gedmin is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a senior adviser at Blue Star Strategies consulting firm and former president and chief executive of Radio Free Liberty. Gary Schmitt is of the Marilyn Ware Center for Security Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Donald Trump clearly views himself as master of the deal.

        "\u201cNow we are going to have Donald Trump\u2019s swamp,\u201d said ethics guru Paul Painter of University of Minnesota Law School. \u201cThe D. C. swamp is going to be from New York. \u201d That\u2019s how Painter described to Right Turn the problems implicit in the \u2019s announcement via Twitter that he will leave his sons in charge of his business but make no \u201cnew deals. \u201d On its face, that makes no sense, Painter said. \u201cWhat is a \u2018deal\u2019? It\u2019s just slang for a transaction. You cannot run a business without transactions.",
        "It\u2019s a measure of just how hilariously awful Donald Trump\u2019s choices to fill his administration have been so far that when the idea began to circulate last week that his daughter Ivanka Trump might end up serving as his de facto first lady, I actually thought, hey, I don\u2019t hate this.",

        "BEIRUT \u2014 A tentative deal to evacuate the last zones in the embattled Syrian city of Aleppo was reached Tuesday after reports of widespread civilian deaths spurred diplomatic efforts, a Russian envoy and rebel commanders said. Details of the deal remained unclear, however. Among the questions: whether the possible escape routes would be open to civilians, where those evacuated would be taken, and what could face rebel fighters choosing to leave.",
        "Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Tuesday vetoed a controversial bill that would have banned abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy but signed a measure prohibiting the procedure later in pregnancy. The measure the Republican governor rejected would have barred a woman from obtaining an abortion if a fetal heartbeat could be detected. The legislature passed the measure last week even though it conflicts with Supreme Court decisions upholding the right to abortion at least until the point at which the fetus is viable.",

With temperatures forecast to be 20 to 35 degrees below average, record lows are likely Thursday and Friday.

        "A movie has been made for \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans that finally answers many of the questions they\u2019ve long been asking, having to do with the tensile strength of a franchise that has experienced its share of strain over 40 years, and the ability of artists with new, perhaps iconoclastic visions to bring a faraway galaxy from long ago into a bold new future. That movie is \u201cStar Wars: Episode VIII\u201d and will be in theaters roughly a year from now. In the meantime, we have \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story,\u201d Gareth Edwards\u2019s perfectly serviceable, if undistinguished, placeholder.",
        "Pamela Taylor, whose racist comments about Michelle Obama propelled a small West Virginia town into an unflattering national spotlight and prompted the mayor to resign, will return to her job as head of a nonprofit group later this month.

        "The Saudi woman was going out for breakfast when she decided to make a statement. Violating the country\u2019s moral codes, she reportedly stepped out in public wearing a multicolored dress, a black jacket and ankle boots \u2014 without a hijab or abaya, a loosefitting garment. Late last month, she tweeted a photo of her outfit, and the post circulated through Saudi Arabia, drawing death threats and demands to imprison or even execute the woman.",
        "As NFL team owners prepare to meet Wednesday in the Dallas area with potential relocations by the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders looming, there is a strong belief within the league that the Chargers plan to exercise their option to join the Rams in Los Angeles beginning next season, according to several people familiar with the league\u2019s inner workings.

        "The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time in a year and signaled that rates could continue to rise next year more quickly than officials had expected. The increase was unanimous and modest, raising the Fed\u2019s key interest rate by a quarter point, from a range of 0. 25 to 0. 5 percent to a range of 0. 5 to 0. 75 percent.

        "MOSCOW \u2014 President Vladi mir Putin is winning. For now. The Russian leader is winning because the War order he has railed against has been thrown into chaos, and the Kremlin\u2019s fingerprints are widely seen to be all over it. A year ago, Russia faced a united Europe, an expanded NATO alliance, a paucity of geopolitical allies and the possibility of four more years of poor relations with the United States under a Hillary Clinton presidency. Today, Putin\u2019s military contingent in Syria just helped the government essentially retake Aleppo.",

News of the hack, coming after the announcement in September of a separate hack affecting 500 million accounts, means that Yahoo has been the victim of the two largest data breaches ever reported. Both have been announced since Yahoo agreed to sell its core businesses to telecommunications giant Verizon in July for $4. 8 billion.",
        "NEW YORK CITY \u2014 A dozen or so technology executives filed into a conference room on the 25th floor of Trump Tower Wednesday wearing suits not usually seen in Silicon Valley. Their combined net worth \u2014 at least $136 billion \u2014 was gilded even for the likes of Trump Tower.

Flynn, the retired Army general tapped to serve as national security adviser in the Trump White House, \u201cinappropriately shared\u201d classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan, newly released documents show. Although Flynn lacked authorization to share the classified material, he was not disciplined or reprimanded after the investigation concluded that he did not act \u201cknowingly\u201d and that \u201cthere was no actual or potential damage to national security as a result,\u201d according to Army records obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act."
