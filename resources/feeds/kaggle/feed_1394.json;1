        "CAIRO \u2014 Traces of explosives have been found on some of the victims of an EgyptAir flight from Paris that plunged into the Mediterranean Sea in May, killing all 66 people aboard, Egypt\u2019s Civilian Aviation Ministry said Thursday. In a statement, the ministry said that it was notified by Egyptian investigators and that a criminal investigation into the crash of Flight 804 will be carried out. The statement provided no further details. There has been plenty of speculation that terrorists may have targeted the Airbus A320, but no group has asserted responsibility.",
        "When Angelina Jolie published an essay in the New York Times about her decision in 2013 to get a double mastectomy, the essay quickly went viral. Jolie\u2019s frank and candid admission that she had inherited a \u201dfaulty\u201d BRCA1 gene that increased her risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer and struggled with what to do struck a chord with people. Jolie revealed that she had undergone a medical procedure rarely talked about openly, much less by celebrities, and said she hoped her experience could help others.",
        "Just in time for the holidays comes the \u201cBest Places to Work in the Federal Government\u201d report, filled with good tidings and bad news for federal agencies. The annual report is awaited each year by top officials who want to look good and avoid embarrassment. That makes sense, because the ratings are a reflection on their leadership. But more than simply showing who is up and who is down, the Best Places report slices and dices data to show why employees are engaged in their work or not. Engagement pays off in productivity and service to the public.",
        "I recently left New York, where I was a fashion editor for nearly a decade, to attend graduate school in the suburbs of D. C. where I grew up. I\u2019m happy to be home in most ways, but there\u2019s one suburban habit that I can\u2019t get used to: yoga pants. Women in my neighborhood go about their entire day in yoga pants and running shoes. Moms with strollers, undergrads on campus, girlfriends meeting up for coffee dates or errands \u2014 I have even seen women dressed this way for cocktails.",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the presidency, according to U. S. officials. Comey\u2019s support for the CIA\u2019s conclusion reflects the fact that the leaders of the three agencies have always been in agreement on Russian intentions, officals said, contrary to suggestions by some lawmakers that the FBI disagreed with the CIA.",
        "At a \u201cthank you\u201d event Thursday night with some of her top campaign donors and fundraisers, Hillary Clinton blamed a personal grudge by Russian President Vladimir Putin for unprecedented interference in the election that resulted in her defeat. Clinton said that in 2011, when she was secretary of state and Putin was planning his return to power, she spoke out against the \u201cphony\u201d parliamentary election that independent analysts concluded was rife with problems and fraud. \u201cAt the same time, citizens of Russia were pouring into the streets to protest. . . .",
        "Hillary Clinton, in audio just unearthed by the New York Times, offers her most unvarnished accounting of her 2016 election defeat yet. And while it\u2019s no surprise that she blames FBI Director James B. Comey \u2014 she\u2019s done that before, if a bit less forcefully \u2014 she also points pretty squarely at another \u201cunprecedented,\u201d actor: Russia. Here\u2019s a partial transcript of Clinton\u2019s comments to campaign donors Thursday night: There were some unprecedented factors that I don\u2019t think we can ignore, because to do so is at our peril. Now, don\u2019t take it from me. Take it from independent analysts.",
        "President Obama said Friday that his administration did not ascribe motives to Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 campaign ahead of Election Day because he did not want to be seen as influencing the outcome in favor of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \u201cAnything said by me or anyone in this White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens,\u201d Obama said at a news conference. \u201cI wanted to make sure everybody understood we were playing this thing straight. That we were not trying to advantage one side or the other.",
        "A Chinese naval ship seized an underwater naval drone that was being used by the U. S. Navy to test water conditions in the South China Sea, the Pentagon said Friday. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident occurred on Dec. 15 about 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay, in international waters in the South China Sea. The USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey vessel with a mostly civilian crew, was in the process of recovering two unmanned ocean gliders, which are used to collect information about water conditions that can help U. S. vessels operate.",
        "President Obama has occasionally used his podium to assume the position of . The guy regularly slams Fox News; he voiced concerns in September about the reporting on Donald Trump; and he has a fixation on fake news. Moments ago, in his press conference at the White House, Obama took direct aim at his audience: scores of mainstream media correspondents and cameras. The topic was the response of news organizations to a series of email hacks presented by WikiLeaks in the heat of the 2016 presidential election.",
        "The good news: Both the left and the right have reached consensus that free speech is important. The bad news: \u201cFree speech\u201d has apparently been redefined to mean \u201cspeech with which I agree. \u201d Over the past few years, there have been many cases of college students or their cowed administrators chilling the public discourse (by disinviting speakers, censoring artwork, disciplining transgressors of arbitrarily imposed cultural appropriation rules, threatening to defund school newspapers, etc. ). Such actions have often been accompanied by dutiful statements about the campus\u2019s commitment to free and open dialogue.",
        "There\u2019s a kind of coup going on in North Carolina, one that tells us a lot about just how far Republicans are willing to go to hold on to power and undercut Democrats. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: After a close election, Democrat Roy Cooper defeated Republican incumbent Pat McCrory to win the governorship. So the Republican state legislature decided to call an \u201cemergency\u201d session before Cooper takes office and strip the governor of as many powers as it could.",
        "MARRAKESH, Morocco \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s kind words and admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin seem painfully naive. Moscow\u2019s interference in the U. S. presidential elections makes their bromance even more unnerving. Yet Trump\u2019s posture is neither unprecedented nor likely to last very long. Kurt Volker and I were on one of those sessions on Thursday at the German Marshall Fund\u2019s \u201cAtlantic Dialogues\u201d conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, where great stuff is said because it is off the record. But the former U. S.",
        "Frederic C. Hof is director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. He advised Hillary Clinton on Syria at the State Department in 2012. Some 70 months ago, unarmed, ordinary Syrians rose peacefully against a regime whose incompetence and corruption they had come grudgingly to accept. It was their rulers\u2019 detention and beating of children that provided the tipping point. The same regime seeks now to capitalize on a bloody victory in Aleppo, where children again have been targeted.",
        "Despite\u00c2 protests, widespread criticism\u00c2 and a threat by the to challenge in court any moves that he believes would unconstitutionally limit his power, the North Carolina legislature has passed\u00c2 changes that would severely limit the incoming Democratic governor\u2019s power. The legislature approved\u00c2 a proposal along party lines Friday that would effectively give Republicans control of the state Board of Elections during election years and split partisan control of local boards of elections, as opposed to giving the governor s party the majorities on those panels. \u00c2 Outgoing Gov.",
        "First ladies aren\u2019t always presidential spouses. In fact, two early uses of the title refer to the beautiful, popular Harriet Lane, niece of James Buchanan, the only lifelong bachelor president. She was an able hostess who, not long before the Civil War, arranged for Northern and Southern guests to be seated apart at a White House function in order to keep the peace. Harper\u2019s Weekly called her \u201cOur Lady of the White House,\u201d and Frank Leslie\u2019s Illustrated Newspaper captioned Lane\u2019s picture thusly: \u201cThe subject of our illustration \u2026 may be justly termed the first lady in the land.",
        "The Vanity Fair review was bad enough. A chunk of decor fell on the magazine\u2019s critic as she dined at Trump Grill, she wrote. The menus were misprinted, and the reviewer used the word \u201cflaccid\u201d twice in one sentence describing the Szechuan dumplings. As for the filet mignon, it \u201ccame out overcooked and mealy, with an ugly strain of pure fat running through it. . . . The steak slumped to the side over the potatoes like a dead body inside a minivan.",
        "The worst of the first surge of Arctic air, unleashed by the polar vortex, is exiting the East Coast. But a second assault, focused on the central United States and Great Lakes, is charging south this weekend. Cities that will catch the brunt of this second blast include Minneapolis, Des Moines and Chicago. The chill is poised to arrive Saturday into Sunday morning. \u201cModels pull negative numbers into the Dakotas and Minnesota by Sunday morning, the coldest air temperatures in nearly three years for many cities,\u201d wrote meteorologist Paul Douglas for the Star Tribune.",
        "The scale of a second Yahoo breach disclosed on Wednesday was staggering, exposing information associated with a billion accounts. But, perhaps even more staggering was that the theft happened three years ago \u2014 and had not been reported until now. That probably left a lot of consumers wondering: Why does it take so long to find out that I\u2019ve been hacked? In Yahoo\u2019s case, the reason for the delay may be a fairly simple one. The company may not have known about the breach.",
        "Kim Jong Un stood on the stage in front of the stylized portraits of his father and grandfather, men he wasn\u2019t supposed to be strong enough or cunning enough to succeed, lauding the \u201cthrilling explosion\u201d of the most recent nuclear test and the \u201cleap forward in all sectors of the national economy. \u201d His suit, his haircut, his glasses, even his gravelly voice were all reminiscent of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the founder and \u201ceternal president\u201d of North Korea who, to this day, remains associated with strength and prosperity.",
        "Both President Obama and Donald Trump believe the United States never should have invaded Iraq in 2o03 (or, at least, Trump claims he now does). The war in Iraq and its chaotic aftermath in many ways prefigure the present moment in the Middle East; it triggered a sectarian unraveling that now haunts both Iraq and Syria and looms large in the minds of an Obama administration wary of further intervention in the region\u2019s conflicts.",
        "Herders select and sort reindeer inside the enclosure. (Sergei ) In about a week, children across America will be staring at the sky in hopes of catching a glimpse of Rudolph or one of his reindeer friends. But for the people snuggled in Russia\u2019s remote Arctic regions there are usually so many reindeer \u2014 an estimated 730, 000 \u2014 that for centuries people have had to herd these creatures to keep the population manageable.",
        "Pressure on members of the country\u2019s electoral college to select someone other than Donald Trump has grown dramatically \u2014 and noisily \u2014 in recent weeks, causing some to waver, but yielding little evidence Trump will fall short when electors convene in most state capitals Monday to cast their votes. Carole Joyce of Arizona expected her role as a GOP elector to be pretty simple: She would meet the others in Phoenix and carry out a vote for Trump, who won the most votes in her state and whom she personally supported.",
        "MOBILE, Ala. \u2014 He strode out on a catwalk at a football stadium here to Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s \u201cSweet Home Alabama. \u201d A cedar tree, which aides installed behind his stage with a crane, was decorated in Christmas ornaments larger than a human head. His crowd, thousands deep, held up familiar signs (\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d) and reprised signature chants (\u201cLock her up! \u201d).",
        "Presidents often are tested early, by unexpected crises or provocations by foreign adversaries. Donald Trump\u2019s first test has come even before he is sworn in, and so far, he has responded with denial, equivocation and deflection. The test has come over Russia\u2019s brazen intrusion into the U. S. election process through its hacking of the servers at the Democratic National Committee and the email account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. Contrary to what Trump said this week, the Russian intrusion was known long before the election.",
        "Donald Trump has named Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( . C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget, signaling his intent to slash spending and address the deficit as president. Mulvaney, 49, was elected to Congress in 2010 in the wave that brought a cohort of younger, staunchly conservative members into the House. Mulvaney quickly staked out ground as one of Congress\u2019s most outspoken fiscal hawks \u2014 playing a key role in the 2011 showdown between President Obama and House Republicans that ended in the passage of strict budget caps.",
        "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 It was just a few seconds, a video clip of several young women laughing and clapping to music, dressed for a party or a wedding in orange headscarves and robes with floral patterns. Then a few more seconds of a young man dancing alone, apparently in the same room. The cellphone video was made six years ago, in a village deep in Kohistan, a rugged area of northwest Pakistan. It was the last time the young women, known only as Bazeegha, Sareen Jan, Begum Jan, Amina and Shaheen, have ever been definitively seen alive.",
        "The Chinese government will return a U. S. naval drone seized this week in the South China Sea, the Pentagon said Saturday, in a move that promises to defuse heightened maritime tensions between the two Pacific powers. Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said that Beijing had agreed to transfer the \u201cocean glider,\u201d a small unmanned vessel used to assess water conditions, back to the United States, but said details on how and when that would occur had not been decided. The latest spike in U. S.",
        "Barack Obama\u2019s speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston was an astonishing piece of oratory. It was also a bit of sleight of hand. Then a U. S. Senate candidate from Illinois, Obama wove his personal ancestry and biography \u2014 black and white, Kenya and Kansas, Hawaii and Harvard \u2014 into the American story of opportunity, multiplicity and solidarity. Not red vs. blue, but united. Out of many, one. David Axelrod calls the address a love letter to America.",
        "Kim Brooks was preparing to fly home with her two children, ages 4 and 1, after visiting her parents in 2012. She needed to replace a pair of headphones \u2014 crucial equipment for keeping her preschool son occupied during the 2 flight. As she left her parents\u2019 house for the quick errand, her son asked to come along. But when they got to the store, he refused to get out of the car, where he was playing on an iPad. Brooks faced a choice familiar to all parents."
