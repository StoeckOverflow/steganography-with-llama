        "The problems started after Erich Burger returned from an unforgettable safari in Botswana and Zambia last month. The Baltimore software engineer got sick the day after he got home. He headed to a community hospital after about a week of fever and chills, thinking he might have malaria given his recent travel to Africa. Clinicians took a detailed travel history, admitted him to the intensive care unit as his blood pressure plummeted and ordered blood tests.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Syria\u2019s government declared Thursday that it had regained full control of Aleppo after the last rebel fighters and civilians evacuated the key city as part of an agreement brokered by Russia and Turkey. The Syrian military announced on state media that \u201csecurity and stability\u201d had been returned to eastern Aleppo, once the largest rebel stronghold. The \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2014 a term used by the Syrian government to describe nearly all of its opponents \u2014 had exited the city, the military said.",
        "John McCain, a Republican, represents Arizona in the U. S. Senate. The words \u201cnever again\u201d ring hollow as the city of Aleppo, Syria, has fallen to regime forces of Bashar . A brutal siege that has ground on for years was finally brought to a bloody end by a surge of Russian airpower, Iranian shock troops and assorted regional militia fighters. As we eulogize the dead of Aleppo, we must acknowledge the United States\u2019 complicity in this tragedy. President Obama speaks of the need to \u201cbear witness\u201d to injustice. He did little else for Aleppo.",
        "Bob Gates has worked in senior national security positions for the past five presidents, Republican and Democratic. So it\u2019s noteworthy \u2014 and to me, encouraging \u2014 that he is advising Donald Trump, too. Gates, a former defense secretary, CIA director and deputy national security adviser, spoke with me by telephone Wednesday about the advice he\u2019s giving Trump and his team \u2014 and the opportunities and pitfalls ahead. At the top of Gates\u2019s list is striking the right balance between improving relations with Russia and appearing too cooperative with a belligerent President Vladimir Putin.",
        "Why did all those Economically Anxious Trump voters reject policies that would have helped relieve their economic anxiety? Maybe they believed any Big Government expansions would disproportionately go to the \u201cwrong\u201d kinds of people \u2014 that is, people unlike themselves. Hillary Clinton\u2019s unexpected loss, particularly in traditionally blue strongholds, has led to lots of rumination about what the Democrats must do to reclaim their political territory. Smarter marketing, smoother organization, greater outreach and fresher faces are among the most commonly cited remedies.",
        "Donald Trump is getting his share of criticism for appointing effective, wealthy business executives and leaders from the private sector to his Cabinet. Democrats would have you believe that people who have been magnificently financially profitable in America are somehow disqualified from helping shape American policy. But here\u2019s a different way of looking at the Cabinet Trump has assembled: This may be the most successful group of people brought together to serve a common purpose in Washington in at least the last 50 years.",

Mattis, I was sad to annouce this month that I could not in good conscience support granting him a waiver to serve as our 26th secretary of defense. I explained that my decision was motivated not by political considerations but by concern for the enduring American principle of civilian control of the military.",
        "The fall of Aleppo just weeks before Barack Obama leaves office is a fitting stamp on his Middle East policy of retreat and withdrawal. The pitiable pictures from the devastated city showed the true cost of Obama\u2019s abdication. For which he seems to have few regrets, however. In his news conference, Obama defended U. S. inaction with his familiar false choice: It was either stand aside or order a massive ground invasion. This is a transparent fiction designed to stifle debate. At the beginning of the civil war, the popular uprising was ascendant.",
        "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Police arrested seven suspects who were allegedly planning a series of bomb attacks in the heart of Australian\u2019s second largest city on Christmas Day, an official said Friday. The seven men had been inspired by the Islamic State group and planned attacks on Melbourne\u2019s Flinders Street train station, neighboring Federation Square and St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Victoria state Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. Police had been watching the alleged plotters for some time, and believed they were preparing to use explosives and other weapons, Ashton said.",
        "Eric Trump is suspending the operations of his charitable foundation \u2014 ceasing all fundraising \u2014 after facing questions about whether the foundation donors might get special access to members of the first family. \u201cNo new money will come into the ETF bank account,\u201d Trump wrote in an email message on Thursday. That decision appeared to go beyond a pledge Trump had made a day earlier to the New York Times: In that interview, Trump said he would cease personally raising money for the foundation, but left the broader fate of the foundation uncertain.",
        "Scientists on Thursday announced a milestone in the fight against Ebola, reporting that a major trial of an experimental vaccine shows that it may be \u201chighly protective\u201d against the virus, which has infected nearly 30, 000 people and killed 11, 000 worldwide since 2013.

Snowden, 33, has been in Moscow since June 2013, when he left the country to avoid prosecution for sharing classified information about NSA and other programs.

He had just assassinated the Russian ambassador to Turkey at a photo exhibition in Ankara. The man who captured the terrifying image, who kept his camera trained at the gunman during the chaos and fear, was not even there to cover the event. The Associated Press photographer was meeting on a whim for dinner with an old friend, who suggested they meet at the photo gallery first.",
        "The first thing that comes to mind regarding serial tripper Grayson Allen is: What makes a person keep doing this? The second, after Duke announced that Coach Mike Krzyzewski had suspended Allen indefinitely following his egregious trip of an Elon (Elon?) player Wednesday night, is: Would a suspension 10 months ago have stopped Allen\u2019s reckless behavior? And, in what might seem ancillary but is far from so for those who care about college basketball: Does anyone remember that Louisville beat Kentucky on Wednesday night?",
        "(This story has been been updated.) Santa may need water skis instead of a sleigh this year. A weather buoy about 90 miles south of the North Pole registered a temperature at the melting point of 32 degrees (0 Celsius) early Thursday, as a giant storm east of Greenland drew abnormally warm air northward. Weather models had predicted temperatures could get this warm and this buoy, part of the North Pole Environmental Observatory, provides validation.",

        "The U. N. Security Council on Friday passed a resolution demanding that Israel cease Jewish settlement activity on Palestinian territory in a unanimous vote that passed when the United States abstained rather than using its veto as it has reliably done in the past. The resolution declares settlements constructed on land Israel has occupied since the 1967 war, including in East Jerusalem, to have \u201cno legal validity. \u201d It said settlements threaten the viability of the solution, and it urged Israelis and Palestinians to return to negotiations that will lead to two independent nations.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke out forcefully against a U. N. Security Council resolution on Friday that condemns Israeli settlements, calling it \u201cshameful\u201d and saying that Israel would not abide by its terms. The resolution criticizes Israel\u2019s settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that the Palestinians hope will be a future state, and says the settlements \u201caltered the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. \u201d The resolution passed with 14 votes to 0.",
        "Donald Trump is signaling a in his battle with the Republican leadership in Congress, which he repeatedly skewered during his attacks on the Washington establishment. Trump has, by all accounts, patched up his relationship with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( . ). To fill top jobs in his administration, Trump has chosen five sitting lawmakers, as well as the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ). And he has passed up opportunities to meddle in congressional business in ways that might have pleased his populist base but frustrated Republican leaders.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s sudden embrace this week of a nuclear arms race \u2014 and his staff\u2019s scramble to minimize the fallout \u2014 underscored an emerging modus operandi for the : governance by chaos. Since winning the election, Trump has seemed to revel in tossing firecrackers in all directions, often using Twitter to offer brief but provocative pronouncements on foreign and domestic policies alike \u2014 and leaving it to others to flesh out his true intentions.",
        "UNNATURAL CAUSES | SICK AND DYING IN AMERICA: Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. In this series, The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. The ads started popping up about a decade ago on social media. Instead of selling alcohol with sex and romance, these ads had an edgier theme: Harried mothers chugging wine to cope with everyday stress. Women embracing bottles of whiskey, and bellying up to bars to knock back vodka shots with men.",

        "It is one of the common questions of theology (which is generally more insightful and useful than theology): If God really exists, why doesn\u2019t he show himself in some dramatic, undeniable way? In response, author and minister Frederick Buechner proposes a thought experiment. What if God were to rearrange the stars in such a fashion that they spell out \u201cGOD IS\u201d in the sky, maybe to the accompaniment of soaring celestial music?

        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. Rare indeed, and bracing, are the moments that strip us of certainties and force us back to consideration of our most fundamental values. Such was 2016. Donald Trump campaigned to an America now largely dependent on televisual and social sources of information and misinformation. Institutions \u2014 such as newspapers, political parties and universities \u2014 that have traditionally helped test and vet evidence and argument hit, and now must face, the limits of their influence.",

        "PRESIDENT OBAMA\u2019S decision to abstain on a U. N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements reverses decades of practice by both Democratic and Republican presidents.
