Ellison\u2019s brother Brian, a Baptist reverend, provided the Church of the New Covenant as a venue for a town hall spotlighting the lawmaker\u2019s bid to run the Democratic National Committee.

But the past two Decembers have made the phrase \u201cendless summer\u201d a reality \u2014 great for our visitors, not so great for us. Floridians \u2014 especially in the southern half of the state \u2014 look forward to ideal winter weather after enduring relentless conditions for six months.

The Jaguars have a record of as they complete their ninth straight season. Their franchise quarterback, Blake Bortles, seems to have regressed this season.

But if you\u2019re still stumped about someone\u2019s gift (or if their name slipped your mind and your list) all is not lost. One of the best things about the Internet is that it transcends the physical \u2014 though not the commercial \u2014 bonds of the holiday season. But just because a gift is electronic, or doesn\u2019t always make it less thoughtful. There are plenty of ways to buy good gifts that will deliver instantly. Plus, you get to save on gift wrap.",
        "The crimes were so horrific that even a longtime prosecutor choked on his words when he recalled what happened to the two victims. On the evening of Dec. 5, 2015, two male students from the University of Rochester were lured to a house several miles from campus, believing they were headed to a party. One of the men and a female acquaintance had been flirting on Facebook, and the young woman invited them to come hang out. Instead, the students walked into a trap.",

        "Jesus is the reason for the season, they say. This is undoubtedly true, but despite what Nativity plays and Hollywood epics would have us believe, the story of the birth of Jesus is more complicated than many people think.

        "In 175 B. C. an insecure, despotic ruler came to power. He was narcissistic and known for a level of extravagance and display that bordered on the bizarre.

At this time of year, charitable donations spike, and the plight of those who struggle edges closer to center stage. But ask people about the best thing they\u2019ve ever given to someone else, and their memory search stretches beyond the cheery rituals of Christmas.
