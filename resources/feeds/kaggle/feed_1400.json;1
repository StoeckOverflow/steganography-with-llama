        "Obviously that carved rhino horn for sale at a foreign marketplace should not come home with you. Nor should the leopard skin, the narwhal tusk and the whale meat. But what about the queen conch from your Caribbean holiday or the caviar from the London airport shop? Not so obvious, is it? Travelers \u2014 and that special subgroup of shoppers who travel \u2014 need know which wildlife items are permitted into the States and which ones are banned. The exotic animal test is unreliable.

        "KABUL \u2014 Three men slumped on their cots in a clean but cramped dormitory room. They looked glum and shellshocked, as if they had suddenly found themselves in a forbidding foreign place. In many ways, they had. Javed Hakimi, Mohsen Amiri and Navid Mohammedi were among 45 unhappy passengers who arrived here under guard on a charter flight from Frankfurt last week. It was the first of many such flights that are expected to return thousands of Afghan asylum seekers from Germany under a European Union agreement with President Ashraf Ghani.",

        "MOSCOW \u2014 It was the second national tragedy in less than a week, once again played out in agonizing detail on national television, once again in the shadow of Russia\u2019s military involvement in Syria. Once again, the nation was left with more questions than answers. Early Sunday, a Russian military passenger plane carrying dozens of members of the Red Army Choir and a beloved and prominent charity worker plunged into the Black Sea minutes after it took off en route to a military base in Syria. All 92 people on board are believed to have died.",

Who got me this?\u201d It wasn\u2019t his mother or father, even though they were dressed as elves. \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d said his father, Donnell Booker Sr. \u201cIt was someone very generous.

        "Picture the commute of the future: You live in Palo Alto, Calif. but work 350 miles away in Los Angeles. After your morning latte, you click on a smartphone app to summon your digital chauffeur. An autonomous car shows up at your front door three minutes later to drive you to a Hyperloop station in downtown Mountain View, where a pod then transports you through a vacuum tube at 760 mph. When you reach the Pasadena station, another car awaits to take you to your office. You reach your destination in less than an hour.",
        "Five days after A&E announced a documentary series about the Ku Klux Klan, the network has abruptly canceled the project. In a statement released on Christmas Eve, an A&E spokesman said the network learned that the show\u2019s producers \u2014 from a production company \u2014 made cash payments to \u201cfacilitate access\u201d to participants, which violates A&E policy.",
        "If there was a theme to the Christmas Eve games, as NFL teams battled for playoff spots and some sort of momentum with the playoffs two weeks away, it was an awful one.

        "The only thing Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco wants for Christmas from his is zero sacks when Baltimore meets the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. \u201cMaybe for one game or so; two games would be nice,\u201d Flacco said (via the team\u2019s website). To ensure his protection, he joked, he dropped thousands of dollars on flashy virtual reality gaming systems for his nine offensive lineman. Santa Flacco always comes through! #ravens pic. twitter.",

        "I\u2019ve been in my room at the Hollander in Chicago about three minutes when I realize I\u2019m not alone. An exaggerated sniffling noise comes from the top bunk, just over my left shoulder, startling me. The fact that there\u2019s someone in my room isn\u2019t as alarming as it might seem. It\u2019s a newly opened hybrid, and I\u2019ve booked a night in a women\u2019s room with six bunks.",
        "Candy and sugar have once again invaded our world. It began innocently enough with a gingerbread house, then lingered with the sprinkle cookies from friends, then endured with the classroom holiday parties, the candy canes that garnish every wrapped present, and the hot chocolate with marshmallows that lures my kids on these cold days. I would like to be the Grinch and shove it all up the chimney. I fear that if they keep up this pace, my children might spiral and sputter by the time Christmas arrives.",
        "President Obama said in an interview released Monday that he could have beaten Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump \u201cif I had run again. \u201d In his most pointed critique yet, Obama said Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign acted too cautiously out of a mistaken belief that victory was all but certain. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer,\u201d Obama said in the interview with former adviser and longtime friend David Axelrod, a CNN analyst, for his \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast. The president said Clinton \u201cunderstandably . . .",
        "With a Senate majority next month, Republicans will have power in numbers. But a handful of GOP senators could arguably have even more power. Just three Republicans could derail some of Donald Trump\u2019s critical nominations, which need to be approved by a majority of the U. S. Senate.",
        "Twitter messages apparently posted by one of Donald Trump\u2019s aides have added some intrigue to the sudden resignation of Jason Miller, Trump\u2019s choice for communications director. A tweet from the account of A. J. Delgado, an adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign and a member of the transition team, appeared Thursday with the message: \u201cCongratulations to the on being named WH Comms Director!\u201d Delgado also appeared to call Miller \u201cThe 2016 version of John Edwards,\u201d a reference to the former U.

Here, too, a congressman a plan to \u201cdefund Muslim \u2018refugees\u2019 \u201d and local residents sued to block construction of the only mosque, a fight that ended at the Supreme Court.

        "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s historic visit to Pearl Harbor with President Obama on Tuesday punctuates the Obama administration\u2019s multiyear effort to prod Japan and its neighbors in Asia to decrease tensions by moving beyond lingering wartime grievances. But as the two leaders pay homage to the 2, 403 Americans who died in the surprise Japanese attack on Dec. 7, 1941, the geopolitical backdrop for the event has been clouded by Donald Trump\u2019s pugnacious and unpredictable pronouncements. During the campaign, Trump raised alarms in both countries when he questioned the value of the U. S.",
        "If Dec. 7, 1941, is the day that Franklin D. Roosevelt said \u201cwill live in infamy,\u201d then Dec. 20, 2016, has got to be a close second. No Americans died that day as they did at Pearl Harbor, but the American Century, as Time magazine founder Henry Luce called it, came to a crashing end. Turkey, Iran and Russia met in Moscow to settle matters in the Middle East. The United States wasn\u2019t even asked to the meeting.",
        "Back in October, a Research Poll found that of Donald Trump voters didn\u2019t trust economic data, thanks partly to their candidate\u2019s insistence that the numbers are bogus. Something tells me this attitude is about to change. After all, Trump will soon take office with among the most favorable economic conditions \u2014 as measured by the government and private data sources \u2014 imaginable. And you can bet that he, and his supporters, will gleefully claim credit. Until things go south, anyway. For now, economic data abound. The most recent jobs report shows the unemployment rate down to 4. 6 percent.",

Poor Americans are facing the gravest threat to the federal safety net in decades as Donald Trump takes office accompanied by a Congress.

        "VENEZUELA, WHICH was once Latin America\u2019s richest country, has become an unwilling test site for how much economic and social stress a modern nation can tolerate before it descends into pure anarchy. This month its 31 million people lurched a big step closer to that breaking point, thanks to another senseless decree by its autocratic populist government. For years Venezuelans have struggled with mounting shortages of food, medicine and other consumer goods, as well as inflation that has rendered the national currency, the bolivar, worthless.",
        "Looking at the decimated landscape for Democrats \u2014 out of the White House, holding fewer than 20 governorships, and in the minority in the House, Senate and vast majority of statehouses \u2014 it is tempting to blame President Obama for the party\u2019s plight. In one real sense, this is correct: With the White House in Democratic hands for eight years and sclerotic House and Senate leaders, a generation of young and capable talent has not developed. The Democratic Party stuck with Hillary Clinton in large part because there was no viable alternative.",

She was a week past her due date, and the baby was coming. But when she stepped off the Metro that spring day in 2015, she turned in the opposite direction from the hospital.

        "BUTARE, Rwanda \u2014 The three officers had received blue badges and slipped blue covers over their helmets. They were now U. N. peacekeepers, sent from Burundi to help protect victims of a brutal war in the Central African Republic. But each of them had a past the United Nations was unaware of.

        "KABUL \u2014 For 30 years, Gen. Abdurrashid Dostum has reigned as northern Afghanistan\u2019s untouchable : first as a ruthless general, later as an armed U. S. ally against the Taliban and finally as a reliable, if unsavory, political boss who could deliver votes from his ethnic Uzbek followers. Dostum has long been infamous for his cruelty: He has reportedly ordered tanks driven over enemies\u2019 legs and been accused of suffocating hundreds of Taliban prisoners in sealed truck containers. He is also known for violent and abusive rages. But none of the accusations ever landed him in serious trouble.",
