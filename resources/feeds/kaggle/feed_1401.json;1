        "The Obama administration is close to announcing a series of measures to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election, including economic sanctions and diplomatic censure, according to U. S. officials. The administration is still finalizing the details, which are also expected to include covert action that likely will involve cyber operations, the officials said. An announcement on the public elements of the response could come as early as this week.",
        "Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday night to defend the charitable foundation he has pledged to close, saying the media had not given him enough credit for his generosity and ignoring the legal issues that have ensnared the organization in controversy. The Donald J. Trump Foundation has come under intense scrutiny this year after reports in The Washington Post detailing its practices, including cases in which Trump apparently used the charity\u2019s money to settle lawsuits involving his businesses.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s depiction of the state of the American economy has consistently been as bleak as it is subjective. The unemployment numbers are fictional, he\u2019s claimed, with the real number perhaps as high as 42 percent! (It isn\u2019t anywhere close.) President Obama\u2019s never achieved 3 percent growth in a year, a first for a modern president! (True when you look at calendar years and presidents after Herbert Hoover.) But Americans don\u2019t often take the big picture view on the economy, either. How the country is faring economically is as subjective for us as it seems to be for Trump.",
        "\u201cI was born famous,\u201d Carrie Fisher said. The daughter of two of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars of the 1950s \u2014 actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher \u2014 she would lead a life of inescapable fame, and the privilege and chaos that came with it. She became a celebrity in her own right, playing the heroic Princess Leia in the blockbuster 1977 film \u201cStar Wars\u201d and two sequels in the 1980s. She was only 19 \u2014 and the principal female character \u2014 when she filmed the first in the George Lucas series that has become a cultural touchstone.",
        "\u2018Some crappy dessert. Anything. I\u2019ll take it all. \u201d That was Carrie Fisher ordering a midafternoon snack at the Cannes Film Festival in May, where she was doing interviews for \u201cBright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,\u201d a documentary about her mother, Debbie Reynolds; Fisher confided that she\u2019d wanted to make the film for the past few years because, as she explained, \u201cmy mother had been sort of declining, and I didn\u2019t know how much longer she would be performing.",
        "FROM THE very beginning, George Lucas knew he had a life force of a young actress on his hands. When first casting his \u201cStar Wars\u201d films, Lucas seriously considered such other budding teenage talents as Jodie Foster and Terri Nunn. Yet Carrie Fisher, still barely an adult at the time, had a silly, presence that melded well with future Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford during auditions. She also had a precocious sense of self \u2014 a quick mind and a feisty steeliness of spine. In short, Fisher reminded Lucas of his own younger sister.",
        "The Israeli government stepped up its running battle with the Obama administration on Tuesday, saying it had proof that the United States had orchestrated a U. N. Security Council resolution condemning settlement activity. \u201cWe have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage,\u201d David Keyes, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night.",
        "Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality. A man says to me, \u201cHow do you like that car?\u201d I\u2019m standing by a little green Kia. \u201cIt\u2019s not mine, it\u2019s a rental,\u201d I say. I\u2019m in the town of Okeechobee, Fla. parked on the main drag in front of Nutmeg\u2019s Cafe. \u201cWhere you from?\u201d he says. \u201cMinnesota. \u201d \u201cI hear they just got more snow up there.",
        "Until Carrie Fisher, \u201cprincess\u201d was a dirty word. Before \u201cStar Wars,\u201d I had seen princesses. I was a little girl, and when you are a little girl, all anyone seems to want to do is to show you princesses to emulate. I wanted no part of it. Princesses were things who got rescued. Princesses wore pink. Princesses sat in castles waiting for their dragons to go off duty and their knights in shining armor to come to the rescue.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us should regret the fact that we got 1, 300 tons of chemical weapons out of Syria. \u201d President Obama and the infamous \u201cred line\u201d he drew on chemical weapons use by Syrian dictator Bashar are Exhibit A in what detractors call Obama\u2019s feckless foreign policy and American weakness. But to Derek Chollet, former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and former special assistant to President Obama and senior director for strategic planning of the National Security Council staff, the opposite is true.",
        "Spare us the . ? It was June 2001 and I was covering President George W. Bush s trip to Slovenia, where he had just met Vladimir Putin for the first time. I and others were struck by Bush s praise for the Russian leader as trustworthy. ? Said Bush: I was able to get a sense of his soul. ? But back in Washington, my editor had no interest in such talk. He rewrote my lede with other news \u201d a tidbit about missile defense \u201d and he moved the ?",
        "Donald Trump won the hearts of Rust Belt whites by giving voice to their anger and giving them a comforting but utterly false narrative to explain their plight. He blamed \u201cglobalism\u201d or \u201cforeigners\u201d or China or stupid Washington insiders or bungled trade deals for the of the heartland and for their fall from the comfortable middle class to the bitter life of hourly laborers. This was and continues to be a great disservice to Trump\u2019s base, one promoted by supposedly \u201csophisticated\u201d conservatives who have bought into the and narratives.",
        "Last night, CNN aired a terrific segment on people from coal country who voted for Donald Trump \u2014 but are now worried that his vow to repeal Obamacare will deprive them of crucial protections that enable them to stay afloat financially. This dovetails with other reporting that suggests a lot of Trump voters may be harmed by repeal of the law. Which raises a question: Did voters such as these know they were voting for this? After all, Trump promised countless times throughout the campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act, didn\u2019t he?",
        "For weeks now, nightmares have been jolting Olga Perez Stable Cox awake several hours before sunrise. Sometimes she\u2019s able to fall back asleep, but more often she finds herself lying in the dark, body tossing and thoughts racing, until she\u2019s reduced to tears. The morning offers fleeting distractions but no permanent relief \u2014 a cup of coffee, some Christmas decorating, maybe a phone call from concerned friends.",
        "American spending, measured in trillions of dollars, boggles the mind. Last year, we spent $3. 2 trillion on health care a number so large that it can be difficult to grasp its scale. A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals what patients and their insurers are spending that money on, breaking it down by 155 diseases, patient age and category such as pharmaceuticals or hospitalizations. Among its findings: Chronic and often preventable diseases are a huge driver of personal health spending.",
        "On Christmas Day, Tricia McCauley made a pie and prepared her signature Brussels sprouts to take to a holiday party with fellow members of the District\u2019s theater scene. At 4:30 p. m. she posted on Facebook that she was on her way. She never showed for dinner. A frantic search by friends and family, scouring city blocks, ended just after midnight Tuesday, when a man walking his dog near Dupont Circle spotted McCauley\u2019s white Scion iQ with its \u201cPlant more plants\u201d bumper sticker. He called police.",
        "Richard Adams, a British writer whose novel about rabbits, \u201cWatership Down,\u201d sold 50 million copies and mesmerized generations of readers by creating an ornately detailed fantasy world and subverting the stereotype of warm and cuddly bunnies, died Dec. 24 at a nursing home in Oxford, England. He was 96. He had a blood disorder, said a daughter, Juliet Johnson. Mr. Adams was an public servant when \u201cWatership Down,\u201d his first novel, was published in 1972.",
        "In a year marked by surprises, it seemed fitting that, as a recent story on Billboard\u2019s website attested, the CD in 2016 came from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who has been dead for 225 years. So move over, Drake. Take that, Adele. Mozart is king. The story was widely picked up and shared, from Forbes to NPR. It seemed to confirm the sad state of a music industry rocked by successive waves of technology and declining sales.",
        "My daughter had an adult moment recently. A graduate student with an internship, she recently was seeing a client, who, at the end of their meeting, called her Ms. Walters and asked for her business card. \u201cI think I\u2019m an adult,\u201d she texted me. There are so many ways \u2014 little and big \u2014 that we mark our kids\u2019 passage to adulthood. When I was in the process of becoming an adult, it seemed like getting married was one marker, though at the time I wasn\u2019t thinking, \u201cNow I\u2019m an adult.",

Dallas defeated the Detroit Lions, to give Washington a clear path to clinching the NFC playoff\u2019s sixth seed on Sunday.",
        "\u201cThe photo of people entrenched at Standing Rock has visual cues to images of protest and, with the barbed wire, even war zones. It is a reminder that even though war seems very far away, every day in our own nation there are front lines and battles being fought. \u201d \u2014 Lam (Stephanie ) As photo editors, we see millions of photos through the year. Many of the images never make publication. Some are inspirational and happy, and some are tragic and terribly graphic.",
        "Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Wednesday harshly criticized Israeli settlements in the West Bank, saying their growth threatens to destroy the viability of a solution to the conflict, and that the United States was obliged to allow passage of a U. N. resolution condemning the activity in order to preserve the possibility of peace. Kerry noted that the number of Israelis living in settlements has grown significantly and that their outposts are extending farther into the West Bank \u2014 \u201cin the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state.",
        "Donald Trump privately told several visitors to his winter retreat in Florida on Wednesday that he is writing the first draft of his inaugural speech and is looking to presidents Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy for inspiration, according to three people familiar with the conversation. Trump told them that Reagan\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d and Kennedy\u2019s articulation of grand national ambitions are central to how he thinks through his own speech, which will be given Jan. 20, the people said.",
        "After having repeatedly praised President Obama\u2019s efforts to ensure a smooth transition, Donald Trump reversed course on Wednesday, accusing the current occupant of the Oval Office of putting \u201croadblocks\u201d in his way.

        "Since Gallup began asking Americans the people they admired the most, there\u2019s been a consistent pattern: Whoever was president or was almost always the man the country admired the most. The most admired woman? Usually someone who had been married to a president. Only five times has the most admired man in the country not been a president \u2014 past, current or elected. And in 2016, the trend continued, with President Obama retaining the title he\u2019s held since 2008.",
        "President Obama on Wednesday created new national monuments in a sacred tribal site in southeastern Utah and in a swath of Nevada desert, after years of political fights over the fate of the areas. The designations further cement Obama\u2019s environmental legacy as one of the most consequential \u2014 and contentious \u2014 in presidential history. He has invoked his executive power to create national monuments 29 times during his tenure, establishing or expanding protections for more than 553 million acres of federal lands and waters.",
        "One of the hallmarks of our democratic system is its commitment to the peaceful transition of power. This practice comes with two important, linked corollaries that fall under the umbrella that there can be only one president at a time. The first is that the incoming president, especially in the arena of foreign policy, takes care not to trespass on the prerogatives of the incumbent. The second is that the outgoing president, once departed, remains largely mute, giving his successor space to operate unimpeded by back seat carping. Donald Trump must have missed this memo.",
        "Not long before the presidential election, Melania Trump gave a rare public address in which she sketched out one of her causes as a potential first lady: \u201cWe have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially on social media. It will be one of the main focuses of my work if I\u2019m privileged enough to become your first lady,\u201d she said. Thus launched an untold number of comments.",
        "Many Americans believe a lot of dumb, crazy, destructive, provably wrong stuff. Lately this is especially (though not exclusively) true of Donald Trump voters, according to a new survey. The survey, from the was conducted in and it finds that willingness to believe a given conspiracy theory is (surprise!) strongly related to whether that conspiracy theory supports one\u2019s political preferences. Remember Pizzagate? That\u2019s the bizarre theory that Hillary Clinton was helping run a child sex slave ring out of a D. C. pizza joint, as allegedly proven by code words in hacked Democratic emails.",
        "Secretary of State John F. Kerry\u2019s dreadfully long and condescending speech rationalizing the U. S. decision to abstain from a vote casting Israel as an international law breaker will convince no one not already in agreement with the Obama administration\u2019s posture. It will fortify the new Congress, the (who tweeted before the speech: \u201cWe cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U. S. but . . . not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U. N.)!"
