        "It was a year like no other in history, and will be the most remarkable in our lifetimes, other than the year to come, and possibly the one after that. If you ever wondered about the validity of the legendary curse \u201cMay you live in interesting times,\u201d we are now finding out.",
        "Even before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as president, Congress is planning to escalate the clash over the U. N. Security Council\u2019s resolution into a conflict between the United States and the United Nations. If Trump embraces the strategy \u2014 and all signals indicate he will \u2014 the battle could become the Trump administration\u2019s first confrontation with a major international organization, with consequential but largely unpredictable results.",
        "The Obama administration has informed Congress of its plans to resettle as many as 19 detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in a final sprint to pare down the inmate population at the military prison, U. S. officials said. Even if the transfers occur before Jan. 20 as planned, about 40 inmates will remain at the facility, a lasting reminder of President Obama\u2019s failure to deliver on his Inauguration Day promise to close the prison and an illustration of the difficulty of following through on one of his central national security goals.",
        "In his latest controversial statement, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, known for his bloody war that has killed thousands, threatened to throw corrupt officials out of a helicopter, saying he has done it before, to a kidnapper, and won\u2019t hesitate to do so again. \u201cI will pick you up in a helicopter to Manila, and I will throw you out on the way,\u201d Duterte said in Tagalog in front of a crowd in the Camarines Sur province Tuesday, according to GMA News. \u201cI\u2019ve done it before.",
        "For now, it seems, the one lasting impact of House Democrats\u2019 on gun control this summer is Republicans\u2019 desire to punish them for it. But figuring out a way to do that without fanning the flames of the gun control debate \u2014 not to mention angering gun control advocates who are more and more willing to fight fire with fire \u2014 could be politically tricky. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) has every incentive to make sure the minority party doesn\u2019t ever again seize the floor.",
        "A bit over 44 million Americans participate in the government\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly referred to as food stamps. That\u2019s a higher number than in most years past, representing about 13. 7 percent of the U. S. population, but it\u2019s down from the high of 47. 6 million in 2013, 14. 9 percent of the population that year. What\u2019s incensing Fox News, though, is that 2016 saw a level of fraud in the system, with $70 million wasted. The network hosted a discussion Tuesday morning with a simple conceit: Should the program therefore be ended?",
        "Breaking: Debbie Reynolds, film star and mother of actress Carrie Fisher, dies at 84, her son says. Actress Debbie Reynolds, whose daughter Carrie Fisher died Tuesday, was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times and other news outlets reported, citing sources. According to TMZ, Reynolds had been at her son\u2019s home to discuss funeral plans for Fisher when family called 911 to report a possible stroke. After Fisher suffered a heart attack during a flight from London to Los Angeles, Reynolds publicly stated that her daughter was in stable condition. Fisher died two days later.",
        "YEKATERINBURG, Russia \u2014 It\u2019s a stirring exhibition of Russia\u2019s struggle to win rights and freedoms that the country no longer fully enjoys. It\u2019s a shimmering memorial to a late president few Russians miss and an era most would rather forget. And although it\u2019s overseen by the Kremlin, it\u2019s also a tacit symbol of defiance to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s authoritarian rule.",
        "If 2015 was the year in which Germany opened its doors to refugees, 2016 was when the country pondered how to close them. Although the influx of refugees peaked more than a year ago, attacks like the one in Berlin on Dec. 19 have led to demands that Germany refuse entry to individuals without passports and step up deportations of criminals and terrorism suspects. Authorities hope that another trend will have a bigger effect in the short run: migrants deciding to go back because they are fed up with Germany or fear deportation.",
        "When police responded to a home in Bentonville, Ark. one Sunday morning last November, they discovered Victor Collins\u2019s dead body in the backyard. Police records describe a grim scene: Collins\u2019s body was floating face up in a hot tub, and his left eye and lips dark and swollen. The resident who had called 911, James A. Bates, told police that he and a few work buddies, including Collins, had stayed up the night before watching football and drinking. Bates agreed to let two of them crash at his house, he told police, then went to bed.",
        "The Obama administration announced sweeping new measures against Russia on Thursday in retaliation for what U. S. officials have characterized as interference in this fall\u2019s presidential election, ordering the expulsion of Russian \u201cintelligence operatives\u201d and slapping new sanctions on state agencies and individuals suspected in the hacks of U. S. computer systems. The response, unveiled just weeks before President Obama leaves office, culminates months of internal debate over how to react to Russia\u2019s provocations.",
        "Donald Trump on Thursday played down the ramifications of any Russian interference in the U. S. election, saying it is \u201ctime for the country to move on to bigger and better things\u201d in a statement issued just hours after President Obama announced sweeping sanctions against Moscow. Trump, who has for weeks voiced skepticism about Russia\u2019s role in the hacking of Democratic email accounts and other hostile actions, said he would seek to learn more about the situation next week.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin on Friday issued a stark warning to the United States, saying it would respond in kind to the U. S. expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and other sanctions following the Russian hacking of U. S. political parties before the 2016 presidential elections. \u201cI cannot say now what the response will be, although, as we know, there is no alternative here to the principle of reciprocity,\u201d said Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov in a statement late Thursday reported by the Interfax news service. He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would decide the exact response.",
        "On Thursday afternoon, the Obama administration announced its retaliation for what has been characterized as Russian interference in November\u2019s presidential election. Among the measures, the White House announced that the State Department would be closing two compounds \u2014 one in Maryland and one in New York \u2014 that it says were used by Russian personnel for purposes. It is also declaring 35 Russians \u201cpersona non grata\u201d for their alleged role in intelligence operations. How hidden were these alleged spy compounds? At least in the case of Maryland, the answer is simple: not very.",
        "\u201cArnold and Tim, if you\u2019d come up, we\u2019re going to give you a nice, beautiful check,\u201d Donald Trump said. He held up an oversize check, the kind they give to people who win golf tournaments. It was for $100, 000. In the corner the check said: \u201cThe Donald J. Trump Foundation. \u201d Along the bottom, it had the slogan of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign: \u201cMake America Great Again. \u201d This was in February. The beginning of it.",
        "Y ou can almost hear Carrie Fisher\u2019s voice come down from on high: \u201cReally, Mom? You had to upstage me one last time?\u201d The instant memorials to Debbie Reynolds came with the words \u201cHollywood legend\u201d before her name. And she was a legend, for different reasons to different people. For one generation, she was the teenage ingenue who, after being discovered at a Los Angeles beauty pageant, delivered her first big Hollywood star turn in the 1952 MGM musical \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.",
        "President Obama\u2019s tenure has weakened America, wounded our alliances and bolstered our enemies. The president may have inherited some difficult circumstances, but he consistently misplayed his hand and made matters worse \u2014 everywhere. The Obama presidency opened in 2009 with an insult to Britain via the clumsy handling of the removal of Winston Churchill\u2019s bust from the Oval Office, and it is concluding with an attempted destructive policy shift that is particularly harmful to America\u2019s vital ally, Israel.",
        "To read a great work of fiction is to step inside the mind of another and see the world from an alien viewpoint. At a time when so many of us view our own countrymen with skepticism and disbelief \u2014 Hold on. No, scratch that. Sorry, I need to come at this another way. Let\u2019s start with a plain admission. The beneficial effects of \u201cthe arts\u201d have been vastly overstated by their proponents, typically artists themselves and university professors in arts and humanities disciplines.",
        "Some progressive activists and commentators are understandably frustrated that the Senate refused to consider President Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Some sued (making borderline frivolous claims). Others argued that Obama could simply appoint Garland without Senate consent. The problem, in both cases, is that the Senate has no constitutional obligation to consider a president\u2019s nominees. While prior Senates largely used this power to withhold consent for lower court or executive branch nominees (leaving some judicial nominees in limbo even longer than Garland) there is no constitutional reason to treat a Supreme Court nomination differently.",
        "2016 was a bumpy year, and The Post\u2019s editorial board commented on many of the ups and downs. The board responded to events around the world \u2014 from the attack at Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub that killed 49 to the United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d from the European Union to the death of Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro \u2014 and argued for political and policy changes at home and abroad. Here are 10 of the topics that, in The Post\u2019s view, mattered most this year.",
        "John Yearwood, who has reported extensively on Africa, is the former world editor of the Miami Herald. On Twitter, @john_yearwood. On a recent visit to New York City, I looked down from a subway overpass on a fight between two men. The shorter of the two pummeled his opponent, who raced across a busy intersection to escape the blows. Then a surprise: He stopped, stiffened his back, rolled up his sleeves and challenged his attacker to come get him. The short guy, suddenly fearing the worse, turned and ran away crying.",
        "Our greatest fear for 2017 and the Trump presidency is not that he will behave irrationally, impulsively and selfishly (e. g. refusing to sell his businesses and comply with the emoluments clause of the Constitution). We know he will. Our concern is that Congress will do nothing about it. Certain GOP senators, key conservative stalwarts and aspirants have not shown consistency and a willingness to stand up to the . Some seem to be taking a approach. (We trust that Sens.",
        "A will take effect across much of Syria from midnight Thursday, the Syrian army announced, in a deal that opposition officials hailed as a rare chance to tamp down violence in the country\u2019s bloody war. In a statement posted to the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) the military declared a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d cessation of hostilities following \u201cvictories and advances\u201d by Syria\u2019s armed forces. But it said the deal excluded \u201cterrorist organizations\u201d including the Islamic State and the country\u2019s affiliate, now an influential component of what remains of Syria\u2019s armed opposition.",
        "There is an old saying in politics: The most dangerous place in Washington is between Chuck Schumer and a camera. And the famously incoming Senate minority leader could find himself in front of plenty of cameras in the months ahead \u2014 but perhaps not always in a way liberals will be terribly fond of. As of next week, Schumer is the de facto leader of the opposition, wielding the best weapon Democrats have to thwart Republican Donald Trump and the Congress: The filibuster.",
        "The truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin last week may have been cut short when the truck automatically deployed its brakes, the result of European Union regulations that require automatic braking systems on large trucks. The new detail, revealed jointly by Germany\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and broadcasters NDR and WDR on Tuesday, may explain why the truck came to a stop after a few hundred feet. In the end, twelve people were killed in the attack, but there are indications that the E. U. advanced emergency braking system may have prevented more deaths.",
        "Frigid air will grip an unusually large portion of the Lower 48 states in just over a week\u2019s time. The cold is predicted to consume almost the entire nation, from the Pacific Northwest to the Southeast, sparing only Florida. While some parts of the country are forecast to experience temperatures 30 to 50 degrees colder than normal, the cold snap will be most remarkable for the amount of real estate it is predicted to cover.",
        "A backlash to globalization appears to be gaining strength around the world. U. S. politicians on both the right and left have called for curbing free trade deals they say benefit foreigners or the global elite. Donald Trump has championed tariffs on imports and limits on immigration, and suggested withdrawing from international alliances and trade agreements. Meanwhile, populist and nationalist governments have gained ground in Europe and Asia, and voters in Britain have elected to withdraw from the European Union.",
        "For decades, the data on median household incomes have shown the same, persistent racial disparities: Asians beating out whites at the top, while Hispanics and blacks hover near the bottom. Asian Americans seem to offer proof that minorities can prosper \u2014 and even leapfrog whites \u2014 if they work hard and jump through the right hoops. For that reason, Asian Americans have often been invoked as a way to excuse the income gaps between whites and blacks or whites and Hispanics. But why do typical Asian American households outearn typical white households?",
        "Far Side cartoons, Ansel Adams landscapes, underwater dogs \u2014 so cliche. Why settle for a humdrum wall calendar in 2017 when you can track your days with CIA paintings showing agency operatives stealing secrets, killing off enemies or even getting killed themselves? January features a painting of a CIA contractor firing an out of an Air America chopper onto a North Vietnamese biplane. Flip to April for \u201cThe First Sting,\u201d depicting a Afghan mujahideen striking Soviet helicopters with a Stinger missile.",
        "Somewhere between Texas and Alabama, something went very, very wrong for eight captive songbirds. A salon owner in the tiny town of Grant, Ala. ordered the canaries from Texas, she told AL. com \u2014 a birthday present to herself. Rhonda King paid an extra $100 to ship them overnight. But her 60th birthday came and went Dec. 5. No birds, and none the next day. Three days late, the letter carrier finally walked into her salon, she told AL. com. \u201cYour birds arrived,\u201d she remembered him saying. \u201cThey\u2019re not alive."
