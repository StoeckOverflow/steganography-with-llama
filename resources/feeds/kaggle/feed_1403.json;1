        "MOSCOW \u2014 On a day when everyone expected him to go low, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the high road, bowing out of a growing diplomatic showdown with the administration of President Obama in a gambit to woo his successor, Donald Trump. In a rare, and calculated, break from the diplomatic tradition of reciprocal punishment, Putin opted to do nothing after the United States said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats and close a pair of properties in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Putin said he would wait to see how U. S.",
        "Donald Trump on Friday expressed his appreciation to Vladimir Putin over the Russian president\u2019s announcement that he would not expel American diplomats in response to new U. S. hacking sanctions as a gesture to the incoming administration. \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin),\u201d Trump tweeted Friday afternoon. \u201cI always knew he was very smart!\u201d Great move on delay (by V. Putin) \u2014 I always knew he was very smart! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, has hit back at claims that authorities were planning to close an American school in Moscow in an act of retribution for U. S. measures against Russia, announced Thursday. \u201cUS officials \u2018anonymously informed\u2019 their media that Russia closed the School in Moscow as a retaliatory measure,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook post, which was later translated by the Russian state news agency TASS. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie. Apparently, the White House has completely lost its senses and began inventing sanctions against its own children.",
        "With just one day to go before he leaves office, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) threw a legal Hail Mary to the U. S. Supreme Court in another apparent effort to undermine his Democratic successor\u2019s ability to govern. McCrory filed an emergency request to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to pause special elections for more than two dozen state legislative districts in 2017 \u2014 special elections in which Democrats could have an opportunity to pick up seats in North Carolina\u2019s legislature.",
        "Indiana lawmakers originally promoted the state\u2019s school voucher program as a way to make good on America\u2019s promise of equal opportunity, offering children from poor and families an escape from public schools that failed to meet their needs. But five years after the program was established, more than half of the state\u2019s voucher recipients have never attended Indiana public schools, meaning that taxpayers are now covering private and religious school tuition for children whose parents had previously footed that bill. Many vouchers also are going to wealthier families, those earning up to $90, 000 for a household of four.",
        "PHOENIX, Ariz. \u2014 This was supposed to be the year Dagny Knutson became a household name by thrashing the competition in the pool in Rio de Janeiro. In 2010, Knutson was widely considered the next breakout American swimming star. At the urging of USA Swimming officials, she said, Knutson turned down a college scholarship and entrusted her career to the Olympic national governing body for the sport. And then it all went awry.",
        "The year started ominously, with a big fire in a big hotel in the Middle East. Remember? You were getting dressed for a party in the waning hours of 2015 and glimpsed cable news in the mirror, where an orange blaze licked the black sky near the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The fireworks show went as planned: artful magenta flashes arching through a drifting wall of smoke. That would be 2016 in a single image. Spectacle upon spectacle. A band of armed ranchers trapped themselves in an Oregon wildlife refuge, in the name of freedom.",
        "Donald Trump, having dismissed as \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cjust another excuse\u201d the conclusion by intelligence experts that Russia intervened in the election to help him win; having suggested that the culprit who hacked into the Democratic emails \u201ccould be somebody sitting in a bed someplace\u201d; having advised, most recently, that \u201cit\u2019s time for our country to move on,\u201d has \u201cnevertheless\u201d graciously agreed to take time out from meeting with the likes of Don King to consider the evidence implicating Russia. Thanks Donald. The most disturbing thing about Russia\u2019s interference with the U. S.",
        "President Obama\u2019s decision to abstain at the U. N. Security Council on a resolution asserting Israel is an international followed by Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s speech haranguing the democratically elected government of Israel, marked a low point, however brief, in U. S. relations and confirmed the president\u2019s irrational sentiments. (In leaving office, the abstention served no rational purpose; it was rather an international temper tantrum.) Israel replied with the harshest words ever uttered to an American president. (\u201cThe Obama Administration conducted a shameful ambush at the U.",
        "CHARLOTTESVILLE I came here during the holidays to visit an old friend who\u2019s fallen on hard times. Amid the cultural sensation of Miranda\u2019s \u201cHamilton\u201d on Broadway, the protagonist\u2019s Thomas Jefferson, has momentarily lost his place of honor in the founding narrative. If Alexander Hamilton is the hero, the Sage of Monticello, though not the villain (that\u2019s Aaron Burr) is an impediment. In truth, Jefferson and Hamilton were indispensable, the yin and yang of American democracy: Jefferson\u2019s love of liberty and Hamilton\u2019s taste for centralized power created the balance that built the world\u2019s economic and military superpower.",
        "Torn between impatience for 2016 to be over already and dread of what might come in 2017? Roger that, America. In fact, if there\u2019s one nation in Europe that feels the same way, it\u2019s my country, Germany. Across the West, 2016 saw disasters, wars, roiling election campaigns, faltering governments, ruthless meddling by foreign powers, and surging populism fueled by anger, fear and the corrosion of trust in public institutions. A harsh and violent year by any measure. On top of it all, David Bowie and Leonard Cohen died.",
        "Naureen Shah is director of security and human rights at Amnesty International USA. The Obama administration is dismantling a homeland security program created to track immigrants from countries in an attempt to prevent Donald Trump from fulfilling his campaign promise to create a Muslim registry. As an American Muslim and human rights advocate, I am hoping against hope that retired Gen. John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary nominee, will not reassemble the program. Kelly is not an obvious champion of human rights. As head of U. S.",
        "ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT Obama\u2019s sanctions against Russia for interfering with the U. S. presidential election came late, his action on Thursday reflected a bipartisan consensus that penalties must be imposed for Moscow\u2019s audacious hacking and meddling. But one prominent voice in the United States reacted differently. Donald Trump said \u201cit\u2019s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things. \u201d Earlier in the week, he asserted that the \u201cwhole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on. \u201d No, Mr. Trump, it is not time to move on. U. S.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May condemned a blunt speech this week by Secretary of State John F. Kerry on the state of the conflict, an unusual move that boosted Britain\u2019s relations with the incoming Trump administration at the expense of President Obama. The rare diplomatic spat between Britain and the United States, which was met with surprise by the State Department, highlighted the influence of the White House. It also pointed to a vast reordering of international affairs expected after Trump takes office in three weeks, as U. S.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 China promised Friday to halt its domestic ivory trade completely by the end of 2017, a decision greeted by environmentalists as offering real hope for an end to a poaching crisis that is wiping out tens of thousands of elephants across Africa. \u201cChina\u2019s announcement is a game changer for elephant conservation,\u201d Carter Roberts, president of the World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement. \u201cThe trade of ivory now faces its twilight years, and the future is brighter for wild elephants.",
        "The decision was not an easy one, wrote Jan Chamberlin. Ever since \u201cthe announcement\u201d \u2014 as Chamberlin called it \u2014 she has \u201cspent several sleepless nights and days in turmoil and agony,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook post that was no longer public by Friday evening. \u201cI have reflected carefully on both sides of the issue, prayed a lot, talked with family and friends, and searched my soul. I\u2019ve tried to tell myself that by not going to the inauguration, that I would be able to stay in Choir for all the other good reasons.",
        "Uber driver Keith Avila picked up a passenger who looked like a girl in a short skirt Monday night. That was the first sign that something was off, he would say later. Two women got into his car with the girl outside a house in Sacramento. Halfway to their destination \u2014 a Holiday Inn in Elk Grove, Calif. \u2014 they asked Avila to turn up the music, he said. Then the women turned to the girl. Avila listened in. \u201cThey were describing what they were going to do when they get there: \u2018Check for guns.",
        "Crews on Friday continued to search Lake Erie after a plane carrying six people \u2014 who had reportedly attended an NBA game \u2014 vanished from radar screens early in its flight, the U. S. Coast Guard said. The Cessna Citation 525, bound for Ohio State University Airport, disappeared from radar \u201cshortly after takeoff\u201d late Thursday night, the Coast Guard said in a news release. The flight had departed from Burke Lakefront Airport, which is located on the shores of Lake Erie in Cleveland. Burke Lakefront Airport.",
        "When the Obama administration announced a massive effort to help distressed homeowners in 2009, it set high expectations. The program, government officials said, would keep up to 4 million borrowers out of foreclosure. \u201cIt will give millions of families resigned to financial ruin a chance to rebuild,\u201d President Obama said at an event announcing the effort. \u201cBy bringing down the foreclosure rate, it will help shore up housing prices for everyone.",
        "This story has been updated. A new law in Michigan will prohibit local governments from banning, regulating or imposing fees on the use of plastic bags and other containers. You read that correctly: It\u2019s not a ban on plastic bags \u2014 it\u2019s a ban on banning plastic bags. Michigan Lt. Gov. Brian Calley signed the new public act into law on Wednesday, along with 11 other bills. Gov. Rick Snyder is currently on vacation out of state, local news sources reported, and Calley has the authority to sign bills into law in his absence.",
        "The nation\u2019s first recreational marijuana shop opened nearly three years ago in Colorado. Since then, a growing body of research has shown that the availability of recreational marijuana \u2014 in Colorado and elsewhere \u2014 is having little to no effect on teens\u2019 propensity to smoke weed. That\u2019s the conclusion, at least, of the official statistics out of Colorado through 2015. It\u2019s what federal data shows nationwide through this year. And it\u2019s also backed up by other federal surveys of drug use in the states where marijuana is legal."
