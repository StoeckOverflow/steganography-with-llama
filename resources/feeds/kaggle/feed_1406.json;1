Manning calls \u201can unshakable faith and trust in God. \u201d Parishioners are struggling to recover from what prosecutors call the methodical bloodlust of a dropout radicalized to hate blacks in the septic swamp of the Internet\u2019s fringes.",
        "The Pentagon has buried an internal study that exposed $125 billion in administrative waste in its business operations amid fears Congress would use the findings as an excuse to slash the defense budget, according to interviews and confidential memos obtained by The Washington Post. Pentagon leaders had requested the study to help make their enormous bureaucracy more efficient and reinvest any savings in combat power. But after the project documented far more wasteful spending than expected, senior defense officials moved swiftly to kill it by discrediting and suppressing the results.",

        "THE MORNING PLUM: The emerging GOP plan to repeal Obamacare on a delayed schedule \u2014 and then maybe kinda sorta replace it later \u2014 has raised a big question: Will Democrats help Republicans pass a replacement that is far less generous and comprehensive than the health law is, allowing Republicans an escape from the political fallout from repeal?

        "We have been chatting informally since Election Day with new and veteran lawmakers, philanthropic organizations, think tanks and longtime political operatives on both sides of the aisle. While unnerved by the election of a demagogic populist and queasy about its implications for democratic institutions, public discourse and America\u2019s place in the world, no one in the few dozen we have spoken with at length is throwing up his or her hands, heading for the backwoods or declaring that the United States is finished.
