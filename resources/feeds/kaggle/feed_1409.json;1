        "The dog stood on her owner\u2019s hospital bed and leaned into his face, sniffing around a tangled mess of wires to find him. Ryan Thomas Jessen had gone to the hospital for what he thought was a migraine, but it turned out to be a brain hemorrhage, his sister, Michelle Jessen, wrote on Facebook earlier this month. The hemorrhage, which doctors believe may have been brought on by high blood pressure, would prove fatal. But before Jessen died, the Californian\u2019s family wanted to let his dog, Mollie, see him one last time.",
        "Our family\u2019s move over to the faux side this holiday didn\u2019t play well on Instagram. Last week, I posted a photo of our recent stop at Home Depot to shop for fake trees. The comments ranged from \u201cWhat? !?!? !\u201d \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cI am so sorry\u201d to \u201cThis AND the election? Way too much for one month. Sigh. \u201d A \u201cface screaming in fear\u201d emoji was posted. And there were offers of candles. I was clearly being . And I totally deserved it.",
        "When my regular babysitter went on vacation, she suggested I hire her younger, sister, who had previously worked for me as a mother\u2019s helper. The morning after our new sitter watched our daughter, I heard how it went. \u201cWe had fun, Mom,\u201d our little girl said. \u201cAnd right before I went to sleep, I talked to a nice, boy. \u201d I felt a frisson of panic run though my body. \u201cWhat do you mean?",
        "Are you getting enough choline? Chances are, this nutrient isn\u2019t even on your radar. It\u2019s time choline gets the attention it deserves. A shocking 90 percent of Americans aren\u2019t getting enough choline, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition. Choline is a hot research topic and for good reason. It\u2019s essential to health at all ages and stages, and is especially critical for brain development. Why aren\u2019t we getting enough? Choline is found in many different foods but in small amounts.",
        "Two Senate Republicans joined demands for a bipartisan probe into Russia\u2019s suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald J. Trump as questions continue to mount about the \u2019s expected decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia. Sens. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) and John McCain ( .) \u2014 the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 joined calls by incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N. Y.) and Armed Services ranking member Jack Reed ( . I.) for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U. S. elections.",
        "Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obama\u2019s signature law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before Donald Trump is even sworn in. But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the law\u2019s insurance would go away.",
        "The election of Donald Trump was a moment in American politics. As in, everything that we \u2014 the collective political horde \u2014 thought was conclusive about how you win an election (outspend your opponent, build a better organization, lead in polling, run more TV ads) was disproved in one fell swoop on Nov. 8. Trump did everything wrong \u2014 by these traditional standards \u2014 and he won. And it wasn\u2019t the first time.",
        "Donald Trump said Sunday that \u201cnobody really knows\u201d whether climate change is real and that he is \u201cstudying\u201d whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year ago. In an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace, Trump said he\u2019s \u201cvery \u201d on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President Obama\u2019s efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut America\u2019s global competitiveness. \u201cI\u2019m still . Nobody really knows,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLook, I\u2019m somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows.",
        "The Post\u2019s blockbuster story on Friday reported: The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U. S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, according to U. S. officials.",
        "Donald Trump talked more about cities than any candidate for president in decades. The picture he painted was bleak. He described \u201cinner cities\u201d as hellholes and depicted urban blacks as the tragic victims of generations of neglect. He visited Detroit, blaming ostensibly liberal public policies for its long depopulation and decline, conveniently overlooking decades of cuts in urban funding and a bipartisan neglect of cities that dates back to the early 1970s. He falsely claimed that urban crime is skyrocketing (it has declined steadily since the early 1990s, falling to a near low). And he pledged to fix it.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Syrian troops pulled out of the ancient city of Palmyra on Sunday as Islamic State militants claimed they had regained full control of the area less than a year after being driven out. Victory in the symbolically significant city would mark a startling reversal of the militant group\u2019s fortunes after months of setbacks and suggests that the Islamic State remains a resilient force.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 When the call to prayer begins in the Palestinian neighborhoods here, the Muslim faithful hear a song beautiful and sublime. Hour by hour, five times a day, it is the soundtrack of their lives. And it stirs deep emotions. Across the walls, across the lines that separate Arabs from Jews, the Muslims\u2019 call to prayer means something very different. The Jews hear noise, they say. And worse.",
        "Mayor Muriel E. Bowser is struggling to stand up to an aggressively liberal D. C. Council, which in the past six weeks alone has legalized assisted suicide in the nation\u2019s capital and guaranteed new parents two months of paid time off. A moderate Democrat whose roots are in the African American neighborhoods of Northeast Washington, Bowser increasingly finds herself at odds with a council infused with the leftist tendencies of the District\u2019s millennial newcomers.",
        "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d didn\u2019t begin with its familiar construction of Alec Baldwin impersonating Donald Trump, but the show still brought in some outside star power for its cold open. In a sketch focusing on Trump\u2019s controversial Cabinet picks, Bryan Cranston reprised his \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d character Walter White to play the incoming president\u2019s nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration. \u201cWalter is amazing, he came highly recommended by Steve Bannon,\u201d Kellyanne Conway (Kate McKinnon) says. \u201cOh, yeah.

        "Are you ready for Deflategate 2. 0? Of course, you aren\u2019t! No one is! That much was immediately apparent from the reaction Sunday when Fox Sports\u2019 Jay Glazer reported that the New York Giants had turned in the Pittsburgh Steelers, telling the NFL that they had used footballs that were not inflated to the rulebook\u2019s specifications last week. The NFL quickly put the kibosh on that report, saying that the Giants had done no such thing and that the footballs used by the Steelers were in compliance with league rules.",
        "General Motors was under fire this weekend after a casting call for Cadillac sought members of the controversial movement. According to an image of the casting call posted by the news agency Reuters and many, many others, the notice said an agency filming the ad was looking for \u201cany and all real . \u201d \u201cThis is a beautifully artistic spot that is capturing all walks of life of America,\u201d the casting call says, adding that it would be filmed later this month. \u201cStanding together as a union.

        "Republican lawmakers are increasingly at odds with Donald Trump across a range of domestic and national security issues, an early sign that the Congress might resist some elements of the \u2019s un or tho dox agenda.

S.",

In filings last week, attorneys for Trump and Andr\u00e9s\u2019s company argued over the details of the session slated to take place the first week of January.

        "BEIJING \u2014 Donald Trump is talking about Taiwan again \u2014 and so is China, in angry and mocking comments Monday that questioned whether the grasps a core element of relations between the world\u2019s top economic powers. In an interview broadcast Sunday, Trump said the United States would not necessarily be bound by the policy \u2014 the diplomatic understanding that underpins ties between Washington and Beijing and that leaves China\u2019s rival Taiwan on the diplomatic sidelines with the United States.

        "On a trip to Germany this month, the deputy head of the Turkish parliament and a close ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had her purse and passport stolen from a hotel lobby. After filing a complaint with the police, she was taken to the police station at the airport, where she waited alongside illegal immigrants and suspects and faced what she described as \u201chumiliating\u201d behavior at the hands of German police before being allowed to board a plane to Turkey.

        "It\u2019s the day after a Nick Kristof column in the New York Times about the academy, which means I have to write about it. A few years ago when Kristof argued that the academy had marginalized itself from larger public policy debates, I took issue with his claims. This time around Kristof is arguing that the academy\u2019s insularity has led to the creation of a political echo chamber, and the 2016 election outcome is the proof: I share apprehensions about Trump, but I also fear the reaction was evidence of how insular universities have become.",
        "\u201cWatch what we do, not what we say. \u201d At the beginning of Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency, that\u2019s how Attorney General John Mitchell explained the way reporters could best understand what the country was about to experience. It\u2019s also good advice for understanding the administration of the billionaire phony populist who will assume the presidency next month. Donald Trump cast himself as the champion of a besieged American working class and a defender of its interests.

        "Just listen to those crickets. A conspicuous hush is emanating from the NFL office on the subject of those soft footballs the New York Giants retrieved from the field against the Pittsburgh Steelers last week. Where was the outrage, the treating of and as more serious than a hijacking? Compare the screams of scandal NFL executives emitted toward Tom Brady and the New England Patriots to this smothered, reaction. It\u2019s a guilty silence, and it leaves NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell beached and exposed."
