        "What an outrage: On Sunday, the National Football League awarded the Tennessee Titans a win over the Denver Broncos because they scored more points, even though the Broncos got more total yards than the Titans.

So is the similarly \u201cfake news\u201d falsehood that a Northwest Washington pizzeria is a front for a child ring run by Hillary Clinton, and so is the \u201cbirther\u201d rubbish championed by Donald Trump, which sought to cast doubt on President Obama\u2019s legitimacy as chief executive.

But the president is not the only Obama whose achievements Trump could roll back. The incoming president also could undo the substantial public health and nutrition changes accomplished with the urging of Michelle Obama.
