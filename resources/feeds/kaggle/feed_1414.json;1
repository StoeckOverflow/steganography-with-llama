        "WARSAW \u2014 The Law and Justice Party rode to power on a pledge to drain the swamp of Polish politics and roll back the legacy of the previous administration. One year later, its patriotic revolution, the party proclaims, has cleaned house and brought God and country back to Poland. Opponents, however, see the birth of a Age \u2014 one that, as Donald Trump prepares to move into the White House, is a harbinger of the power of populism to upend a Western society.",
        "Jeremy is founder and president of J Street. As the Nazis rolled into Vienna in 1938, my father was helping boats full of Jews escape down the Danube River. He had been sent to Vienna by Menachem Begin and the Irgun, the Jewish freedom fighting movement, to save Jews from the Nazis. The operation he ran is credited with saving thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of lives. At the same time, my mother and her family escaped Vienna in 1938, not down the river, but over the Swiss mountains. Her grandmother and many cousins weren\u2019t so lucky.",
        "The members of the electoral college make their votes official Monday, and many people have been imploring the ones committed to Donald Trump to cast their ballots for someone, anyone, else. Among those lending their voices are a group of celebrities you might have seen in this video, in which Martin Sheen, Debra Messing, B. D. Wong, Bob Odenkirk, Moby and a bunch of other famous entertainers earnestly explain how the time has come for the electoral college to serve its original purpose, or at least make a statement of Americans\u2019 collective unease about Trump.",
        "In the tour for her new book \u201cSettle For More,\u201d Fox News host Megyn Kelly has spoken at length about a certain progression over her career. After claiming that she was sexually harassed in the by Fox News chief Roger Ailes, Kelly reported the incidents to a supervisor and then put her head down.

        "This post discusses the plot of \u201cRogue One,\u201d which I reviewed last week, and much other \u201cStar Wars\u201d ephemera. In 2017, the war between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance will have been going on for 40 years, at least as counted in Earth time, ever since the opening music came up and introduced us to \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV \u2014 A New Hope. \u201d The fictional conflict has been by presidents and has moved a whole lot of movie tickets.",
        "Well, that takes chutzpah. President Obama is criticizing Donald Trump for failing to attend what The Post calls \u201cthe most exclusive, and arguably most important, daily meeting in Washington\u201d \u2014 the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) \u2014 warning his successor that without the daily intelligence brief, \u201cyou are flying blind. \u201d This coming from the same person who skipped more than half of his daily intelligence briefings in his first term.",
        "As they fanned out across the Sunday shows, Donald Trump\u2019s closest aides and a number of GOP spinners evidenced a frightful willingness to deny the existence of a cyberattack on American sovereignty and democracy because it might make Trump feel less like a winner. Consider this exchange with Reince Priebus: WALLACE: Trump told me last weekend that the CIA conclusion that Russia interfered with the election to help him was, quote, \u201cridiculous,\u201d and it could have been some guy in a basement.",
        "President Obama pardoned 78 people and also granted commutations to 153 nonviolent drug offenders who were sentenced under harsh and outdated laws and would have received lighter sentences if convicted today. In total, Obama has pardoned 148 people and granted 1, 176 commutations for federal inmates under the clemency initiative that he and former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. launched two years ago. Obama plans to issue more commutations before he leaves office, White House Counsel W. Neil Eggleston said.",
        "The city of Charlotte on Monday abandoned a nondiscrimination ordinance that helped spark North Carolina\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d clearing the way for legislators to potentially drop the highly criticized measure that prompted lawsuits and cost the state jobs and tourism dollars. North Carolina\u2019s Roy Cooper, said Monday he has been told that due to Charlotte\u2019s actions, state lawmakers would call a special session Tuesday to vote on repealing the measure known as House Bill 2 (or \u201cH.

        "ZURICH \u201d A gunman dressed in black stormed into the prayer hall of a mosque frequented by Somali immigrants and opened fire, wounding three people before fleeing, a Zurich police spokesman said Monday. Police, who rushed to the scene in a central neighborhood known for trendy cafes and the city s district, were also investigating a possible connection to the discovery of a corpse at nearby Gessner bridge over the Sihl River, police spokesman Marco Bisa said.

        "The House Select Committee on Benghazi has settled a lawsuit brought by a former staffer who alleged that he was fired in part because he was unwilling to focus solely on the State Department and Hillary Clinton in order to understand the attacks, attorneys for the staffer said. The settlement ends a messy dispute that raised questions about whether the committee \u2014 formed to investigate the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans at U. S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya \u2014 was trying to achieve partisan goals.",

        "International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde was found guilty Monday of criminal negligence for a government payout to a business tycoon eight years ago while she served as France\u2019s finance minister, but the IMF said she will remain as the fund\u2019s managing director. The French court chose not to sentence Lagarde to a fine or jail time.

        "The Obama administration finalized a rule Monday morning that aims to protect thousands of miles of streams by forcing coal mining companies \u201cto avoid mining practices that permanently pollute streams, destroy drinking water sources \u2026 and threaten forests,\u201d officials said in a statement. Under the rule, which overhauls regulations in place for more than three decades, coal companies that have finished mining in an area will be required to restore the land to the same condition that existed before digging began. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell called the new regulations \u201ca balanced approach to meeting the nation\u2019s energy needs.",
        "In a world characterized by rising temperatures, deforestation and other human influences on the environment, the spread of infectious disease is a hot topic. Many recent studies suggest that environmental changes can affect the transmission of everything from malaria to the Zika virus \u2014 and it\u2019s increasingly important to understand these links, scientists say. This week, a new study has provided new evidence that environmental changes can increase the threat of disease.",
        "For the first time, scientists have found evidence of specific and changes in the brains of pregnant women. The changes were measured in brain areas that are responsible for social cognition and the ability to understand the thoughts and intentions of others, suggesting that they may intensify maternal bonding with a newborn.

        "Lou Harris, an influential pollster and political consultant who was among the first to provide polling services directly to candidates and officeholders and helped guide one client, a junior U. S. senator from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy, to the White House, died Dec. 17 at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 95. The cause was a heart ailment, said a son, Peter Harris, a retired pollster who worked with his father. Polling for much of its history was a public affair. Surveyors mined data from voters and released results without consulting with party bosses or candidates.",
        "(Maja Daniels) Swedish photographer Maja Daniels has spent three years documenting life in a French geriatric hospital. Her project, \u201cInto Oblivion,\u201d tells the story of patients with dementia who live in a locked section of the hospital. Within the images, Maja has captured a fascination by the patients with doorways. The haunting pull to these portals seems to echo patients\u2019 awareness of their isolation. In November, Daniels won the first grant given by the Bob and Diane Fund, a $5, 000 award that will allow her to publish her photographs.",
        "President Obama moved to solidify his environmental legacy Tuesday by withdrawing hundreds of millions of acres of federally owned land in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean from new offshore oil and gas drilling.

        "BERLIN \u2014 The German capital was on high alert Tuesday with one or more attackers still at large in a deadly truck assault on a Christmas market, an act claimed by the Islamic State that struck at the heart of Europe\u2019s Christian traditions. Chancellor Angela Merkel decried Monday\u2019s assault \u2014 in which a truck carrying a payload of steel plowed into festive stalls and fairgoers in Berlin, leaving 12 dead and dozens injured \u2014 as a presumed \u201cterror attack,\u201d even as German police scrambled to find the culprit.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 A team of Russian detectives arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to join the investigation into the slaying of Moscow\u2019s ambassador by a Turkish police officer \u2014 an act portrayed by both countries as an effort to rupture a rapprochement between the two regional powers backing opposite sides in Syria\u2019s civil war.

        "Ed Schultz used to be the bombastic lefty host of a syndicated radio show and daily MSNBC program. He befriended Hillary Clinton, called Donald Trump \u201ca racist\u201d for his birther views, and once beseeched God to take Dick Cheney \u201cto the promised land. \u201d In 2014, he ripped Russian President Vladi mir Putin\u2019s \u201cnasty\u201d human rights record. He also torched American conservatives for siding with the Russian president as a counter to President Obama. \u201cPutie is their new hero,\u201d sneered Schultz. But the times have changed. And so has Ed Schultz. In MSNBC handed Schultz his last paycheck.",
        "We were told in June that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked by Russians. We were told in October that material subsequently passed on to WikiLeaks came from the same source. Numerous articles were written about these leaks and about Donald Trump\u2019s many Russian connections. And yet no one was really outraged until now. Why? I have a theory: Until you have seen for yourself how disinformation works, you laugh at the very idea of it. Once you have understood its power, you stop laughing.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, in conservative writer Salena Zito\u2019s memorable formulation, take him seriously but not literally. They will be forgiving if, say, he doesn\u2019t literally get Mexico to pay for a border wall, or if he doesn\u2019t literally ban all Muslims from entering the United States. But in other areas, Trump\u2019s supporters perhaps should have taken him literally \u2014 because they now may have a serious problem. Vox senior editor Sarah Kliff wrote a poignant account last week of her visit to Whitley County, Ky.",
        "Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality. It is hard to believe that the Creator of our universe with its billions of galaxies could have sent Himself to this little blue blip not so long ago in the form of an infant born to a virgin, to be first worshiped by illiterate shepherds where He lay in a feed trough, livestock peering down at Him, Eastern potentates following a star to the site. But here we are again, singing those songs, so we shall see. My mother loved Christmas with her whole heart.",
        "A report by the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Fred Kagan,\u201dUnderstanding Russia today: Russia\u2019s many revisions,\u201d should be required reading in the incoming administration and Congress. He explains: [Vladimir Putin] is redefining Russian identity in the terms the tsars used in the 19th Century \u2014 Russian Orthodoxy, nationalism, and strong government (they called it autocracy, but he does not). He claims the right to renegotiate the terms of the bad deals Russia made with the states, by force if necessary.",
        "We\u2019re now a month away from the inauguration of Donald Trump, and only a couple of weeks away from the of a new Congress, one that at long last knows that it no longer has to worry that its bills will be vetoed by a president from the other party. As you might expect, many Republicans are giddy with excitement over all the new laws they\u2019ll be able to pass, as they remake America into a paradise of liberty, prosperity and strong values.",
        "\u201cOh, I totally disagree with that. \u201d \u201cThat\u201d was the assertion in a 2012 New York Times profile of Valerie Jarrett that \u201cif Karl Rove was known as George W. Bush\u2019s political brain, Ms. Jarrett is [President] Obama\u2019s spine. \u201d Jarrett\u2019s immediate pushback in the 20th episode of \u201cCape UP\u201d explains why she is the senior adviser to a president in a town famous for inflating egos and corrupting souls. She never forgot for whom she worked. Make no mistake: Jarrett is very proud of her accomplishments.",
        "The FBI told a federal judge that it needed to search a computer to resume its investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server because agents had found correspondence on the device between Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin but they did not know what was being discussed, according to newly unsealed court documents.",
        "The way Tyshika Britten saw it, she had a choice. She could explain to children who still believe in Santa Claus that some years are harder for him than others. She could stand on the street with a sign and a bucket. Or she could turn to an unlikely place for help \u2014 Craigslist. She began typing. \u201cI am a mother of six, 5 boys and 1 baby girl,\u201d she began."
