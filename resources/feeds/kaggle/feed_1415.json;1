        "Candidates matter. We learned that lesson for the umpteenth time over the past two years as races \u2014 from the presidential on down \u2014 turned on the quality of the candidates. As a consultant put it to me a long time ago: If the dog doesn\u2019t like the dog food, it doesn\u2019t matter how good the marketing campaign for it is. Today we tackle the candidate who voters sniffed at and decided to pass on. Tomorrow, the flip side \u2014 the best of the best candidates of 2016.",
        "In October, physician Tamika Cross took a Delta Air Lines flight home from the wedding of a childhood friend. A man fell ill and a call went out for medical help. But when Cross tried to come to his aid, a flight attendant dismissed the young, black doctor. \u201dWe are looking for actual physicians or nurses,\u201d the flight attendant said, according to Cross. The story, shared via Facebook, triggered thousands of comments, and an outpouring of stories from minorities and women who had faced skepticism from people who didn\u2019t think they looked like doctors.",
        "It\u2019s not normal, and it\u2019s happening again. For the second year in a row in late December and for the second time in as many months, temperatures in the high Arctic will be freakishly high compared to normal. Computer models project that on Thursday, three days before Christmas, the temperature near the North Pole will be an astronomical degrees and approaching 32 degrees, the melting point.

        "Separate groups of the world\u2019s leading technology companies are launching two initiatives to curb \u201cthe worst forms of child labor\u201d and other abusive practices in the supply chain for cobalt, a key ingredient in batteries that power smartphones, laptops and electric cars. About 60 percent of the world\u2019s cobalt originates in the Congo, where mines rife with dangers attract legions of poorly equipped \u201cartisanal\u201d miners who work for as little as $2 a day.

        "Accused rapist on campus? University should have told us, students say https: . pic. twitter. \u2014 AJC (@ajc) December 19, 2016 For three years, Benjamin Holm walked the Catholic campus at Loyola University in Chicago like any other student, pursuing a double major in finance and economics and playing for the school\u2019s golf team. But his life in Chicago hid the reality he faced back home in the suburbs of Atlanta. There, he was being investigated for rape.",
        "Airports are getting more love from travelers when they act like a mall. More and more, air passengers are responding positively to the Rodeo and gourmet restaurants that continue to pop up across airports, according to J. D. Power\u2019s annual survey of large, North American airports. As amenities on planes have been taken away, the airports themselves have gotten more luxurious. \u201cThere is a high, positive correlation in our data between those people who are extremely satisfied . . . and the amount of money they spend in the airport,\u201d said Michael Taylor, director of airport practice at J.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 The prime suspect sought in the deadly attack on a Berlin Christmas market \u2014 a Tunisian migrant \u2014 was the subject of a terrorism probe in Germany earlier this year and was not deported even though his asylum bid was rejected, a senior German official said Wednesday.",
        "North Carolina lawmakers failed Wednesday to repeal a law regulating transgender people\u2019s use of public restrooms, despite convening in a special legislative session for the express purpose of rescinding the controversial law. The legislature adjourned Wednesday evening after a brutal day in which Republicans feuded over whether to fully or partially repeal the measure, and Democrats accused them of reneging on a pledge to eliminate completely the \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which requires people to use the public restroom that matches with the sex on their birth certificate regardless of their gender identity.",
        "NEW HAVEN, Conn. \u2014 A major increase in international enrollment in recent years has intensified the competition for entry to America\u2019s top private colleges and universities, as numbers of applicants angle for the limited supply of seats. That tension is particularly evident in the eight prestigious Ivy League schools: Federal data shows that their freshman classes grew slightly from 2004 to 2014 \u2014 5 percent \u2014 while the number of incoming foreign students rose 46 percent. At the same time, applications to the schools shot up 88 percent.",
        "Donald Trump believes that those who aspire to the most visible spots in his administration should not just be able to do the job, but also look the part. Given Trump\u2019s own background as a master brander and showman who ran beauty pageants as a sideline, it was probably inevitable that he would be looking beyond their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for a certain aesthetic in his supporting players. \u201cPresentation is very important because you\u2019re representing America not only on the national stage but also the international stage, depending on the position,\u201d said Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller.",
        "Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to stand by his plans to establish a registry for Muslims and temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from the United States. Speaking outside his resort in Florida, Trump did not walk back the proposals after he was asked by a reporter whether he was rethinking or reevaluating them in the wake of a fresh terrorist attack in Berlin. \u201cYou know my plans,\u201d Trump said. He went on to add that the attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which was claimed by the Islamic State, had vindicated him.",
        "Some things Donald Trump says enrage me, while others get under my skin. The pronouncement that does both is his regular claim that until he prevailed, Americans were not free to say \u201cmerry Christmas\u201d to each other. He was at it again last week in West Allis, Wis. during his Victory Tour. Trump declared: \u201cSo when I started 18 months ago, I told my first crowd in Wisconsin that we are going to come back here someday and we are going to say merry Christmas again. Merry Christmas. So, merry Christmas everyone.",
        "What a year it has been for James Comey! At the start of 2016, the FBI director enjoyed a reputation as a public servant of high integrity, earning bipartisan acclaim for his stewardship of the nation\u2019s preeminent law enforcement agency. A year later, the FBI, after a series of blows to its credibility, seems increasingly partisan. Comey has shown himself to be an inconsistent leader. And an ugly conclusion is becoming difficult to escape: He singlehandedly caused Donald Trump to win the presidency.",
        "\u201cTo change anything in the Navy is like punching a feather bed. You punch it with your right and you punch it with your left until you are finally exhausted, and then you find the damn bed just as it was before you started punching. \u201d \u2014 Franklin Roosevelt, 1940 SAN DIEGO What the former assistant secretary of the Navy said is descriptive of the entire military.

        "THROUGHOUT HISTORY, violent, authoritarian movements have tried to exploit the freedom, openness and diversity of democratic societies for undemocratic purposes, turning their most cherished strengths into potentially mortal vulnerabilities. If any country understands this, it is Germany, where National Socialists first destabilized the Weimar Republic through demonstrations and propaganda and then took it over via the ballot box. During the Cold War, terrorist groups shook West Germany to its core \u2014 before effective law enforcement, their own blunders and, crucially, repudiation by mainstream citizens ultimately defeated them.",
        "In this uncertain world, there are still a few unalterable facts of political life. For example, Republicans always do what Charles and David Koch, the billionaire bankrollers of politics nationwide, tell them. Then again, maybe not. As it happens, the Koch brothers are dead set against the House Republicans\u2019 business tax reform plan, yet GOP leaders are pushing it anyway. At issue is the proposed cash flow tax (DBCFT) which despite its name is anything but a tepid idea. To the contrary, it could affect business models across Corporate America.",
        "IN MAY 1988, when Vice President George H. W. Bush was running for president, he was appalled to read in the newspapers that a lawyer claiming to have influence with him had been hired by a New York defense contractor. The vice president wrote a letter to his son George, published by the New York Times, admonishing him to beware of newfound friends who will \u201cask for things\u201d and reminding him to avoid any sign of impropriety. The family of Donald Trump would be wise to absorb the letter and spirit of Mr. Bush\u2019s message.",
        "More Americans have signed up to have health plans through the Affordable Care Act as of Jan. 1 than in previous years, despite spiking insurance prices and a pledge by Donald Trump to dismantle the law.

        "Russia\u2019s popularity among Americans has once again dropped to Cold depths, according to a new poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs released on Wednesday. The poll found Americans giving Russia an average rating of 32 when asked to rate their feelings toward Russia from 0 to 100. That score is down from an average of 40 in the organization\u2019s June survey, and marks the lowest score on this measure since 1986, when Russia\u2019s rating stood at 31.",
        "The Washington Post has 17 foreign bureaus staffed with correspondents covering war, terrorism, politics and refugee crises. But it\u2019s often the small moments, the intimate encounters with people at the heart of these stories, that prove the most memorable. We asked our correspondents to reflect on the stories that meant the most to them this year. Here\u2019s what they said: \u2019I was on the beach at 4 a. m.",
        "Snow on Christmas creates the magical scenes that have inspired songs and stories. Even some people who detest snow are enamored by visions of a glistening white landscape on Christmas Day. So which fortunate locations in the Lower 48 will enjoy a white Christmas this year? Presently about 40 percent of the nation has some snow cover and these numbers shouldn\u2019t change too much by Dec. 25. Snow cover on Dec. 21.

        "The Italian name for the caldera \u2014 Campi Flegrei, or \u201cburning fields\u201d \u2014 is apt. The 7. cauldron is the collapsed top of an ancient volcano, formed when the magma within finally blew. Though half of it is obscured beneath the crystal blue waters of the Mediterranean, the other half is studded with cinder cones and calderas from smaller eruptions. And the whole area seethes with hydrothermal activity: Sulfuric acid spews from active fumaroles; geysers spout water and steam and the ground froths with boiling mud; and earthquake swarms shudder through the region, 125 miles south of Rome.",
        "If you were planning to serve whipped cream with your holiday desserts this year, you might want to acquaint yourself with the homemade kind. Thanks to a nationwide shortage of nitrous oxide, a critical ingredient in aerosol whipped creams, some major manufacturers have announced that they won\u2019t be able to keep up with holiday demand. Among the companies that expect to see shortfalls are ConAgra, which makes whipped cream and Dean Foods, which sells whipped creams under a range of local brands. But the impact of the shortage will likely be more widespread than that, experts say.",
        "Three weeks before her wedding day, Cheyann Shaw uploaded a video to YouTube, a space the fitness fanatic regularly filled with workout clips and health tips. But this time was different: She was now using the social video platform for a more emotional and profound purpose. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry,\u201d she said in the video, \u201cbut \u2014 I was told that I have cancer. \u201d Shaw has stage 4 serous ovarian cancer, a rare and but stubborn strain that can be resistant to chemotherapy treatments.

        "Before lunchtime Thursday, Donald Trump said he would expand the U. S. nuclear arsenal, upending a reduction course set by presidents of both parties over the past four decades, and called for the United States to veto a pending U. N. resolution that criticized Israel\u2019s settlements policy. The policy prescriptions, communicated in morning tweets, followed calls since last month\u2019s election to reconsider the U. S. relationship with Taiwan and to let China keep an underwater U. S. vessel seized by its navy.",
        "Donald J. Trump piled on fresh criticism of the Pentagon\u2019s most sophisticated aircraft on Thursday, suggesting that he might abandon the Joint Strike Fighter in favor of an alternate plane due to high costs. In a message on Twitter, Trump said that cost overruns in Lockheed Martin\u2019s $400 billion program to develop the stealth aircraft had prompted him to ask Boeing, another major defense manufacturer, to \u201c a comparable Super Hornet. \u201d Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin I have asked Boeing to a comparable Super Hornet! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Donald Trump named Republican National Committee official Sean Spicer as White House press secretary, filling what is likely to be a challenging position given Trump\u2019s sometimes hostile relationship with the media and his propensity to bypass staff to communicate directly with the public on Twitter. Spicer, the RNC\u2019s communications director since 2011 and chief strategist since 2015, has become an increasingly visible presence on Trump\u2019s team since the GOP nominee won the election on Nov. 8.",
        "The Obama administration on Thursday took the unprecedented step of creating obstacles to a but poorly understood plan by Donald Trump to establish a Muslim ban or registry \u2014 by dismantling the registry system that already exists. The Department of Homeland Security issued a \u201cfinal rule\u201d to formally dismantle the regulatory framework for the National Security Registration System (NSEERS) a preexisting government program that was used to register and monitor visitors from \u201c \u201d countries from 2002 to 2011.

        "Twelve days before the presidential election, FBI Director James B. Comey dispatched a senior aide to deliver a startling message to the Justice Department. Comey wanted to send a letter to Congress alerting lawmakers that his agents had discovered more emails potentially relevant to the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. The official in Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates\u2019s office who received the FBI call immediately understood the explosive potential of Comey\u2019s message, coming so close to the presidential election."
